            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing caſt by the publique ſtorme upon a remote ſhore, whence I behold the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world with a calmer judgement, becauſe former troubles have left me little occaſion to be much concerned in the latter; I find my ſelfe invited by this uncertaine interval of unexpected reſt to meditate how I may find the reſt of the ſoule and contentment of mind in all conditions. And ſeeking it for my ſelfe, I may be ſo happy as to procure it to others.</p>
            <p>For that contemplation I made uſe of foure bookes, this halfe-wilde countrey affording but few more, The chiefe is <hi>the holy Scripture,</hi> the meditation whereof brings that peace which paſſeth all underſtanding. The next is the <hi>booke of Nature;</hi> Then the <hi>booke of Gods providence</hi> in the conduct of the world, both teaching me to ſay with David,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 92.5.</note> 
               <hi>Thou Lord haſt made me glad through thy workes.</hi> The fourth book is that which every one carrieth along with himſelfe, <hi>the ſpirit of man.</hi> A booke where there is much to be put out, and much put out which muſt be renewed, before wee can reade in it any ſubject of peace and content, for
<pb facs="tcp:170100:4"/>without the corrections of grace this natural booke is, like that of Ezekiel,
<note place="margin">Ezeck. 2.10.</note> 
               <hi>written within and without with lamentations and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and woe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the worke of wiſedome and my endeavour in this treatiſe, ſo to correct this fourth booke upon the three others, that wee may ſtudy it with delight, and find peace and contentment within us, which may ſpare us the labour to ſeeke it abroad. That wiſedome which muſt worke in us that excellent effect, is divine wiſedome; <hi>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; happy is every one that retaines her.</hi> And humane wiſedome inſtructed by the divine ſeconds her, and does her good ſervice in that greate worke.</p>
            <p>This philoſophie ſwims againſt the ſtreame of a great torrent. So I call the numerous abettours of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent moral Philoſopher, Doctor <hi>Charron</hi> my countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who with great care ſeparates divine wiſedome from the humane, and attributes to the humane alone that which onely belongs to the divine,
<note place="margin">Preface to the three bookes of wiſedome.</note> to <hi>make a man walke alwayes upright, ſtedfaſt, and content in himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have more ſerene intentions in this booke, which beares on the front the Peace and contentment of mind then to carpe at the learned and the dead. And it grieveth me much to diſſent from that brave man whom I truly admire, acknowledging his booke of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be of rare excellency, and of ſingular uſe to ſuch as know how to uſe it aright. But it grieves me more that he hath perſvaded ſo many ſeeming wiſemen,
<pb facs="tcp:170100:4"/>pretenders to the magiſtracy of wit,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity is not a dependance of Religion, and that the vertue and integrity of Divines is altogether frowning, chagreene, auſtere, ſervile, ſad, timorous, and vulgar.</hi> One would think that he is drawing the picture of ſome old barefooted ſhee vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. But <hi>Philoſophical wiſedome,</hi> that is (as he expounds it) <hi>the human and civil,</hi> he makes it <hi>free, cheerefull, lofty, noble, generous, and rare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is likely that <hi>Charron</hi> deſcribing Theological wiſedome weeping, auſtere, baſe, and poore ſpirited, had before his eyes thoſe rules of monaſtical diſcipline which he made once a ſhew to affect, though very ill agreeing with his free maſculine, and lofty ſpirit, as ſetting forth piety and wiſedone in a ſervile and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy dreſſe. Had he lived till now, his ſolid rational wit had liked no better of the delicate and poetical piety that came ſince upon the ſtage of France, ſome of it publiſht in Engliſh to little purpoſe. Where in ſtead of reaſon and authority to ſatiſfie the judgement and comfort the conſcience, you ſhall find poſies of light courtly conceits, as if they preſented the devotion of the people with beades of roſebuds, ſhedding in their hands that turne them. Theſe two different wayes of piety are unſavoury to philoſophical minds that would be payed with reaſon and good ſenſe, which if they find not in religion, they will forſake it, and ſeeke for wiſedome in Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>I owe that duty to Theological wiſedome to make it appeare, to my power, that ſhe is the true Philoſophy,
<pb facs="tcp:170100:5"/>and that to her that magnificent character is proper and ſpecial,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> to make a mans ſpirit <hi>firme, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, free, cheerefull, univerſal, content every where,</hi> which priviledges Charron reſerveth to <hi>civil wiſedome.</hi> It is a high injury offered to piety to take vertve and moral Philoſophy from her juriſdiction, and transport to humane wiſedome that which is proper to the divine,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> even <hi>the skill of living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, which is all.</hi> Let us endeavour to ſhew by our example that Divinity doth not handle wiſedome <hi>auſterely and drily</hi> as he doth reprove her, but <hi>ſweetly and pleaſantly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which hee ſaith to be proper to humane wiſedome. And that wee may reſtore that to Religion which Charron takes from her, let us thinke it no ſhame to take place among thoſe whom hee condemneth. <hi>They take</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Religion to bee a generality of all good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 5.</note> 
               <hi>that all vertues are comprehended in it, and are ſubordinate to it. Wherefore they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no vertue or righteouſneſſe, but ſuch as moveth by motives of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I profeſſe my ſelfe one of them that thinke ſo, preferring to Charrons authority, that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>makes Religion a generality of all good,</hi> in this pregnant text.
<note place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>Finally, brethren, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, vvhatſoever things are juſt, vvhatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver things are pure, whatſoever things are love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any vertue, and if there be any praiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:170100:5"/>think on theſe things.</hi> I hope with Gods helpe to juſtifie that unto true piety it properly belongs, to ſet a man at peace with God, with himſelfe, and with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; to ſet a right order in his ſoul by rectifying his opinions, and governing his paſſions; to make him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in proſperity, and patient in adverſity, wiſe, tranquill, generous and cheerefull as long as he liveth, and glorious after his death. In theſe few words I have ſet downe the argument and order of this Booke. If all theſe are within the precincts of piety, very little will remaine for humane wiſedome ſeparate from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious to make a man vertuous and happy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charron</hi> very wittily alledgeth that many Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have been good and vertuous, and yet irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: To which the anſwer is, that it is an indulgence when they are called good and vertuous without the knowledge and love of the divine and ſaving truth: and that ſuch of them as have been neereſt to that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, had reverend opinions of the God-head, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſilly ſuperſtitions of that age. Alſo that their want of religion hath made their pretended vertue maimed and monſtrous, as in the caſe of killing ones ſelfe, which <hi>Charron</hi> (after <hi>Montagne</hi>) eſteeme two much, and dares not condemne it without a preface of reverence and admiration. This he hath got by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating Vertue from Religion; proving by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that Nature without grace cannot but ſtumble in the darke, and that to guide ones ſelfe it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have good eyes, but there is neede of the light from above.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170100:6"/>
            <p>Whereas we ſhould make a faithfull reſtitution to Religion of all that is vertuous in Pagan Phyloſophy, as deſcended from the Father of lights, and belonging to the patrimony of the Church; this man does the clean contrary, robbing Religion of thoſe things which are moſt eſſentiall to her, to beſtow them upon humane wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; ſolliciting vertue to ſhake off her ſubjection to Religion her mother and Soveraine, and to make her ſelfe abſolute and independent. Himſelfe forgets to whom he oweth that wiſedome of which he writes; In the Schoole of Religion he had got his beſt learning; to Religion, alſo hee ſhould have done his homage for it.</p>
            <p>Can all the Bookes of humane wiſedome afford ſuch a ſublime Philoſophy a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that of the Lord Jeſus, when hee teacheth us to be prudent as ſerpents, and harmeleſſe as doves. Not to feare them that kill the body, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not kill the Soul. Not to care for the morrow, becauſe God cares for it, and becauſe to every day is ſufficient the affliction thereof. Not to lay up treaſures in earth where the moth and the ruſt ſpoyle all, but in Heaven where they ſpoyle nothing. And when he brings us to the ſchoole of Nature, ſometimes to weane us from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous cares by the examples of Lillies of the field which God cloatheth; and of the birds of the aire which he feedeth; ſometimes to perſwade us to doe good to our enemies, becauſe God makes his Sun to riſe upon good and evill, and his raine to fall upon the juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
            <p>How many leſſons and examples doe wee finde in
<pb facs="tcp:170100:6"/>Scripture of heroicall magnanimity? Such is the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> who profeſſed that when hee was weake, then he was ſtrong, and that he fainted not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that while the outward man decayed, the inward was renewed day by day. Such is the Philoſophy of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> who bore with joy the ſpoyling of their goods, knowing in themſelves that they had a better and an induring ſubſtance. Such alſo is the Phyloſophy of <hi>David,</hi> who was confident never to be removed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God was at his right hand; and taking him for the portion of his inheritance, he looked through death and the grave to the glorious preſence of Gods face, and the pleaſures as his right hand for evermore.</p>
            <p>This is Theologicall wiſedome. Is it <hi>all frowning chagreene, auſtere, ſervile, ſad, timorous, and vulgar?</hi> Is it not <hi>all free, chearefull, lofty, noble, generous, and rare?</hi> Let us acknowledge that it is the onely wiſedome that makes man free and content. If the Sonne of God ſet us free, we ſhall be free indeed: Out of him there is nothing but ſlavery and anguiſh.</p>
            <p>Satan the great enemy of God and men could not have deviſed a more effectuall courſe to diſgrace god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and caſt men headlong into perdition, then to ſeparate wiſedome from religion, and portray religious wiſedome weeping, trembling, with a frighted looke, and hooded with ſuperflition. They that take ſo much paines to prove, that religion and wiſedome are things altogether different, have a great mind to ſay, if they durſt, that they are altogether contrary. And if any be perſwaded by <hi>Charron,</hi> that to be wiſe and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               <pb facs="tcp:170100:8"/>one needs not be religious, he will come of himſelfe to beleeve that he that would be religious cannot bee wiſe and vertuous. Certainely who ſo conceiveth once religious wiſedome in that ſad, ſervile, and timorous Idea, which <hi>Charron</hi> aſſignes to her, muſt needs think that wiſedome and vertue loſe their name, and goe from their nature when they will be religious.</p>
            <p>There is then nothing more neceſſary in this age, in which Atheiſme is dogmatizing and ſpeaking bigge, then to demonſtrate that the beginning and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wiſedome is the feare of God. And in ſtead of that prodigious method, to withdraw men from religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (that is from God) to make them wiſe and content; that truth muſt be preſt unto the heart, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wiſe and content but by joyning himſelfe with God by a religious beliefe, love, and obedience.</p>
            <p>That we fall not into a contrary extreme, wee muſt take heede of robbing humane wiſedome of her office and praiſe. And we muſt acknowledge that ſhe needs to be imployed about many things in which piety is not an actour, but an overſeer: But piety muſt never bee ſevered from her, for where ſhee gives no rules, yet ſhee ſets limits. Piety muſt bee miſtreſſe every where, humane wiſedome the ſervant. Now it is the ſervants duty to do many things which the miſtreſſe wil not put her hand to, ſtanding more upon her dignity then to deſcend to inferiour offices. In which although piety hath no hand, yet ſhe hath an eye to them, and lets nothing ſcape her knowledge.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, humane wiſedome confines not her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:170100:8"/>to inferiour offices, but aſſiſteth Piety in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. She doth her good ſervice when ſhe keepes in her owne ranck. But ſhe goeth out of it when ſhe preſumes to governe her Miſtreſſe, ſubjecting faith to reaſon, and conſcience to worldly intereſſes.</p>
            <p>In this Treatiſe, I conſider piety and wiſedome as the meanes to obtaine the peace of the ſoule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of minde. Not to vote for the Epicureans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Stoicians by ſubordinating vertue to content; for I am of opinion that theſe two things muſt be ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated the one to the other by turnes, as the uſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Now my preſent uſe is to employ vertue for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of mind. Wherein I hope not to be cenſured as ſubjecting vertue to contentment, in ſtead of ſubjecting contentment to vertue, theſe two being all one if they be well conſidered; for the onely way to content our mind is to be vertuous, and to be vertuous we muſt get a tranquill and contented ſpirit. It is well done to prefer vertue before contentment; but it is well done alſo to invite men to vertue by the contentment that vertue yieldeth. Since all men are great lovers of themſelves, and much led by their pleaſure, let us huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that voluptuous humour, and the love that every one beares to himſelfe, to make them inducements to render unto God his due, making ingenuous mindes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the onely way for them to be pleaſed, &amp; upon good ground, with all that is within and about them, is to ſtudy to pleaſe God; and that duty and content con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in one and the ſame thing.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170100:9"/>
            <p>For theſe Meditations, the want of bookes, even of my private collections, which at the firſt was to mee ſome diſcouragement, in the progreſſe of the work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved rather a helpe. The leſſe opportunity I had to read, the more liberty had I to contemplate. Truly, if after ſo many writers, the publique ſtock of holy Philoſophy is yet capeable of new improvement, it muſt be expected from thoſe who being but little aſſiſted with the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of others, are put to make more uſe of their owne ſenſe and experience. Many times God ſends more grace where there is leſſe helps otherwayes.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Goſpell is called a Teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the declaration of the laſt Will of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. By that Will, he leaves his peace to his Diſciples, and being neere his death tells them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.17. <hi>My peace I leave unto you, my peace I give unto you.</hi> For ſince Jeſus is called <hi>the Prince of Peace, Iſaiah</hi> 9.5. his proper legacy to his heires, is <hi>peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How comes it to paſſe then that ſuch as beare themſelves as Chriſts heires by Will, yet will not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170100:10"/>take his legacy? &amp; that Peace is no where a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtranger then in the Chriſtian Church, to whom it was left by an eſpeciall title?</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, that the peace which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour left to his Diſciples is not the temporal but the ſpirituall, which is the peace of man with God, &amp; with his owne conſcience; wherefore he tells them, that <hi>he gives it not as the World gives it.</hi> But it is true alſo, that the want of that ſpirituall and inward peace brings outward war, as Saint <hi>James</hi> teacheth us, <hi>James</hi> 4.1. <hi>VVhence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your luſts that warre in your members?</hi> He that is well with God and himſelfe, and keeps his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in order, quietly brought under the rule of the feare and love of God, will neither lightly provok quarrells, nor be eaſily moved with provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. He will be little concerned in publique contentions, and gently get off from particular.</p>
               <p>This is the roote of the evill, that we ſeek not to be inveſted in the poſſeſſion of that peace of God, which the Lord Jeſus left us by his Will, &amp; now ſo graciouſly preſents unto us by his word and ſpirit, and that wee diſturb the work of that good ſpirit the ſpirit of peace, ſiding with our tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and vicious paſſions againſt him.</p>
               <p>When we loſe that peace, we loſe all other goods, for in peace all good is comprehended. It is the extent of the word <hi>peace</hi> in Hebrew, that philoſophical tongue. That ſoul, where the peace
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170100:10"/>of God dwelleth, doth ſincerely reliſh his ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſings, and turneth evill into good. But a vicious unquiet ſpirit doth not <hi>taſte how the Lord is gracious</hi> 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.3. And turneth good into evill, as a liver inflamed with a burning Fever, is worſe inflamed by nouriſhing meats.</p>
               <p>The objects that moves deſire and feare in this world, are for the moſt part indifferent in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; good to him that uſeth them well, evill to him that knoweth not how to uſe them; So that good and evill lye within a mans ſelf, not in things without <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.14. <hi>A good man ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied from himſelf,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon.</hi> This is a beaten ſubject though never ſufficiently conſidered. If it were, it would frame the ſoule to piety &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and make a mans ſpirit free, cleareſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, maſter of all things, and (which is more then all) maſter at home.</p>
               <p>The way to attaine to that command of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward State, is to yield it to God, who being our great principle and our original being, imparts his freedome, &amp; a beame of the ſoverainty of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime nature, to the ſoule that draweth neer unto him from whom it is deſcended. God being the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne of the ſoule as of all creatures, the ſoule cannot have any rule at home but from him, nor enjoy it under him without a free ſubjection to his will.</p>
               <p>That peace and liberty of the ſoule whereby a man having all his intereſt in heaven, is diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170100:11"/>to all things in the world, walketh confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent among dangers, and entertaineth with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and ſerene face good and evill ſucceſſe, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier deſcribed then obtained. Yet we muſt not be diſcouraged, but ſtudy to deſcribe it, that we may obtain it in ſome meaſure, for it is gained by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. And the beſt kinds of meditation upon that peace, is, to lift up our ſoule unto God the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible fountain of peace, which he makes to flow upon thoſe that draw neer unto him.</p>
               <p>We ſhall never fully injoy that peace, till wee be fully united with the God of peace; A perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unſuitable with this life, where the beſt are often drawn aſide from God, by the wandring of their thoughts, and the diſorder of their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which made St <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 6. that <hi>while we are at home in the body wee are abſent from the Lord.</hi> Yet ſo much as a faithfull man enjoyes of the peace of God, vvhile he lives in the fleſh, is as much above the moſt floriſhing peace of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Kings of the vvorld, as Heaven is above earth. And vvhere it is vvanting, the higheſt earthly glory, vvhich dravves the envy of men, ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to move their pitty. Without it, the gariſh ſhew of honours and treaſures is like a richly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered night-cap upon a head tormented with a violent meagrime. And all that worldly pompe is not only uſeleſſe but hurtfull, ſowring the mind with cares, and firing the appetite with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which afterwards teare the conſcience with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170100:11"/>remorſe, or benumme it into a deadly lethargy. Whereas the peace of God is a Paradice, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of paſſions, the Schoole of vertue, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God within the ſoule. Bleſſed and holy is he that hath it. and to him is next in happineſſe and holineſſe, he that ſincerely endeavoreth to get it, and to that end yeelds to God the raines of his affections, brings his will under Gods will, and humbly invites him to fixe his dwelling, &amp; beare rule within his breaſt.</p>
               <p>It is the end that I aim at, in this worke. And I beſeech the God of peace, ſo to bleſſe and honour it, as to make it an inſtrument to work His peace in the ſouls of his ſervants, beginning at my ſoule.</p>
               <p>To that work every Chriſtian ought to put his hand as he loveth God and himſelfe. To which wee are the more induced and in a manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the contrariety of the Time. While the ſtorme of warre or inteſtine diſſenſions is raging in all parts of the world, not leaving one ſafe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for peace, the wiſe Chriſtian muſt take ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary in that inward peace, that peace of God, which though it paſſe all underſtanding, yet will dwell in the underſtanding and the affections of thoſe that faithfully ſeek it, and keep both hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God through Jeſus Chriſt. Get once God within you, you have a ſhelter at home againſt all injuryes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; as he that in a tempeſtuous raine flyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170100:12"/>a Church, and in Gods houſe finds peace and ſafety, whilſt the whole aire abroad is enflamed with lightnings, and roaring with thunder; and the land floods are hurling down houſes, drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheep and ſhepheards, and deſtroying the long hopes of the Husbandmans labour. For the faithfull ſoul is Gods Temple, which he graceth by his preſence, and bleſſeth with his peace, not ſuffering it to be removed though the earth be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and though the mountains be carried into the midſt of the Sea.</p>
               <p>This peace at home, in which our duty and our happineſſe are concentred, is an inviting ſubject for a diligent contemplation. Let us examine wherein conſiſteth the true peace of the ſoul and contentment of mind, and how wee muſt keepe peace with God, with our ſelves, with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, in adverſity, in proſperity, and in all the occurrences of life.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe fundamentall rule of great reformations is to bring things to their beginning. By that rule, that wee may know the true peace of God and how wee may get it, wee muſt caſt back our ſight upon the beginning, how God gave it to man, and how he loſt it ſoone after. And here
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170100:12"/>wee muſt uſe that which the Spirit ſayd unto the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Remember whence thou art fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man newly created after Gods likenes was in perfect peace with him: for God, making an image of himſelfe, would not have made it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from him; and peace is a prime lineament of Gods Image. That firſt human ſoule, recently breathed out of Gods mouth, followed with delight the freſh and pure traces of his divine production; and man, finding in himſelfe the likneſs of his Creator, tooke a great joy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to compare that copy with the original. That moving image of God did imitate his actions, as doth the image of our body in a glaſſe. And whereas in the worke of regeneration, St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the new man, is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him,</hi> and that he <hi>is created after God in righteouſnes and true holines,</hi> it followes, that the firſt man was created ſuch, ſince wee learne that ſuch muſt be the renewing of man, to be created againe after the image of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe lively expreſſes of the image of God, <hi>knowledge, righteouſnes, and holines,</hi> could not be in that firſt man, without an entire peace and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with his Creator. And having peace with God, he had it alſo with himſelfe; His deſires were not at variance with his fears, nor his knowledge with his actions; His thoughts belyed not his words; His cupidity did not draw againſt his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170100:13"/>conſcience, &amp; his conſcience layd no accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. From that good intelligence with God and with himſelfe, he could not but reape a great content in his mind; that content alſo being a lineament of the image of God, to whom, as holines, ſo happines is natural and eſſential.</p>
               <p>For that contentment of mind he got no ſmal contribution from the beauty and plenty of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſmiling upon him, and the willing ſubmiſſion of all animals flocking about him, as loving ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, meeting to wellcome their new Soveraign. For his peace with God kept all creatures in peace and obedience under him: Abroad, the clemency of the aire, and the pleaſantnes of a garden of Gods planting delighted him. And at home, his familiarity and free acceſſe to his Maker filled him with joy and confidence. And his original righteouſnes (if he could have kept it) would have perpetuated that bleſſed peace unto him; for peace is the moſt proper effect of righteouſneſſe, as it is expreſt by <hi>Iſatah, The work of righteouſneſſe ſhal be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſſe quietneſs &amp; aſſurance for ever. Iſa.</hi> 32.17. Truly, God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to eat of that excepted fruit upon paine of death, did intimate that as long as he kept in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, death could take no hold of him, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the appurtenances of death: for ſuch are all the infirmities of the body, all the griefes of the mind, and all the croſſes of this life. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the eighteenth Chapter is copious upon this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170100:13"/>that life is inſeperable from righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and mortality from ſinne.</p>
               <p>This laſt was juſtified by wofull experience; for man going from his righteouſneſſe forfeited his life and his peace: And preſently, a dark cloud of confuſion and miſery troubled his golden ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The voyce of God which was the joy of man, ſuddenly became his terrour; Gods preſence which was his life, became ſo formidable to him, that it went for a currant truth, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Wee ſhall ſurely dye, becauſe wee have ſeene God.</hi> Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen off from God, moſt part of the creatures fell off from him, and that rebellion continued e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince. Thoſe that have ſenſe and motion open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny to yeeld ſubjection unto him, flee away from him when he will come neere them, or flye upon him with open hoſtility: And to get ſervice from them, he muſt tame them young, before they be able to reſiſt him. Other Creatures deſtitute of ſenſe, yet ſeeme ſenſible enough to let him know, that they yeeld to him a forced ſervice. Neither can the earth be wonne to doe any good for him, but by great labour and long expectation: Diſeaſes enter into his body with the meate that he eateth, and the aire that he breatheth. Stormes beat upon him, Summers ſcorch him, Winters chill him. Foxes have holes, and birds of the aire have neſts, their garments are natural, warme in winter, light in ſummer: To man onely, Nature gives not where to lay his head; nor ſo much as a skinne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

               <p>And yet that diſcord between man and nature is leſſe then the diſcord between man and man. For generally, men advance themſelves by their mutual ruine, and ſeldome get any of the goods of this world, but by the evill of another; Warres, lawſuits, envies among Neighbours, and domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que quarrells, make the face of the world like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a wild rugged field, full of thorns &amp; bryers; if not liker unto a ſtormy Sea, where the waves break one another continually. It is the raigne of diſcord and confuſion.</p>
               <p>And yet the diſcord of man with his own kind, is not ſo grievous as his diſagreement with his owne ſelfe; I mean the naturall and unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man. For reaſon, which bore a peaceable and uncontrouled rule within mans ſoule, before he was eſtranged from God, finds no more that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obedience of the facultyes and affections. His general inborne notions of goodneſſe and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are now and then darkned with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular violent ſuggeſtions of the appetite, caſting a thick cloud before the eye of the underſtanding: Reaſon her ſelf ſtudieth her own deluſion, putting a diſguiſe of good upon evill; Many times alſo a man knowing and condemning evill, followeth it at the ſame time; being alike unable to blind his judgment, and rule his paſſion. Then, as paſſions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170100:15"/>are pulling againſt Reaſon, they will alſo pull one againſt another; as when ſubjects nave ſhaken off the yoke of their King, the State breaketh into factions, and every one is pulling for himſelfe. Wrath and luſt, wil fiercely buſtle the one againſt the other, as two land flood torrents falling from two oppoſite mountains. The like between feare &amp; deſire, covetuouſneſſe &amp; ambition, love and je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; or if one paſſion raignes alone, it doth ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over the heart. To teare a mans ſoul, and bring him to ſlavery and miſery, there needs no more but luſt or envy, or impatience of revenge.</p>
               <p>In a heart lying under that tyranny, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his own ſlavery, when God by his ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the worke of regeneration, then begins ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of diſcord; of which St <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe two are contrary the one to the other, ſo that you doe not the things that ye would.</hi> This is a more irreconcilable quarrell then the other betweene the vicious paſſions, which many times will agree to do evill, and yeeld one to another by turnes, as the occaſion ſerveth; But between the fleſh and the ſpirit, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the feare of God and the corruption of our nature there can be neither peace nor truce; Vice muſt fall and break his neck before the fear of God, as Dagon before the Arke, unleſſe that God irritated by a pertinacious reſiſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his feare and knowledge from a ſtubborne
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170100:16"/>heart; and then it is not God but man that is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, for while he ſhakes off the free yoake of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, he puts on the ſlaviſh yoak of his unruly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and becomes a drudge to feed the greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an imperious and inſatiable maſter. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.22. <hi>There is no peace ſaith the Lord for the wicked.</hi> The caſe is deplorable of a conſcience deſtitute of the feare of God and faith in his promiſes, where the heady untamed paſſions have ſnatcht the rains from the hands of reaſon. It is the fable of Phaeton turned into a ſtory; for reaſon, too weak for the head-ſtrong appetite is overturned from his ſeate, the celeſtial light is quencht in the ſoule, the fire of cupidity is kindled in the heart, the unruly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions runne wild their ſeverall wayes, and the man is caſt headlong into perdition.</p>
               <p>That perdition is the final ſeperation from God and the endleſs diſcord with him, which begins in this very life. Yet as long as a man liveth upon earth, he hath a ſhare in that generall love of God to his creatures, and the goodneſs and patience of God inviteth him to repentance. But after this life is done, God is an open enemy to thoſe that have lived in emnity againſt him, and abuſed his grace &amp; long patience. To deſcribe that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate, the Lord Jeſus calls it <hi>outward darkneſs; worme that dyeth not, a fire that is not quenched, where there is wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Imagine if you can, what it is to be ſhut out from God the father of light, and driven away from him for ever; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170100:16"/>that, a hideous darkneſs, a worme gnawing, a fire burning, wailing and gnaſhing of teeth, late remorſe, deſpair, hatred of ones ſelfe, and all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable diſtreſſes are but conſequences of that miſery of miſeryes, to be hated of God and hate him for ever.</p>
               <p>Of that incomprehenſible miſery the ſuburbs are the torments of conſcience in this life, to which the racks, the wheeles, and the fires, are not comparable. How grievous thoſe torments are, many forſaken wretches have ſufficiently expreſt it, who being tortured by their conſcience, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to conceive any deliverance from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal expectation of hell, have choſen rather to leape into hell, by a deſperate ſelfe-murther, then to endure any longer the angry face of God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing them. And the miſerable ſoules find there, what they ſeek to avoid; <hi>Amos</hi> 5.19. <hi>as if a man did flee from a Lion, and a Beare met him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The examples are frequent of thoſe whom the ſecret laſhes of conſcience have forced to make an open declaration of their hidden crimes, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that they were upon Gods rack. But truly the examples are yet more frequent of ſeared and benummed conſciences, which by paſtimes, companyes, buſineſſes, and the deceitfulnes of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, divert their mind from that formidable thought of the quarrell, that is betweene God and them; coſening themſelves, as farre as they can, with a vaine opinion that the way to ſcape Gods
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170100:17"/>juſtice, is, not to think of it; and, that they may not think of it, they enjoine their reaſon not to beleeve it.</p>
               <p>But that numneſſe is unworthy of the name of peace: There is great difference betweene ſafety and ſecurity, betweene having peace and not thinking of warre. Such men are like paſſengers ſleeping in a ſhip that is ſinking; or like that wee have heard with horrour and compaſſion, that beſtial ſouldiers condemned to death, would drink <hi>luſtick,</hi> and goe drunk to the gallowes; This I ſay is the behaviour of moſt part of the world, who bearing their condemnation in their conſcience, make them-ſelves drunk while they are going downe into perdition; ſometimes with ſtrong drink, but continually with the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes and the pride of life, and with worldly cares and projects, being of opinion that it is needleſſe to think of death, becauſe it comes without thinking.</p>
               <p>But in that carnal lethargy, conſcience will ſtart up by intervalls and pinch drouſy hearts: Eſpecially when adverſity lyeth heavy upon their perſons and familyes, and when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den dangers overtake them. Then doe they ſee the angry countenance of Gods juſtice; Their owne crimes take them by the throate, and they ſeeme ready to ſay as <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Eliah</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. <hi>haſt thou found me mine enemy?</hi> And God ſaith to their heart with anger, <hi>I have found thee, becauſe thou haſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170100:17"/>ſold thy ſelfe to worke evill in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> There is no conſcience ſo ſunk in a deepe ſleepe of ſinne and worldlines, but will now and then awake, and cry out in a ſudden fright. So did <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> though a Pagan, an extortionner, and a man every way infamous; for, <hi>as St Paul reaſoned of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and righteousnes and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and anſwered, Goe thy way for this time, Act.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever hath read bookes and men, may have obſerved what unquietnes, crimes will bring to the criminal; That tyrants continually ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a naked ſword hanging over their head; That the wicked flee, when no man purſueth; That murtherers and perfidious men have a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſleepe, and their mirth is interrupted with parentheſes of frownes and grimme lookes; That when they excuſe themſelves of a foule fact, of which their conſcience accuſeth them, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience many times gives the lye to their words, and they are contradicted by the inconſtancy of their lookes, and the ſtammering of their tongue. And conſcience will double theſe terrours, when their end draweth nigh. Many know who he was that ſtarted up often in his mortal drouzines on his death bed, commanding that his men ſhould give over ſlaying.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that the wicked, that have the world at will, had as much reſt within as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, yet <hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the reconciliation of man with God, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Such being the enmity betweene God and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, which is followed with the diſcord of man with nature, &amp; with his kind, &amp; with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; How welcome, how precious to him muſt the bleſſed newes be of Gods reconciliation with him? <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5.27. <hi>How beautifull upon the mountaines are the feet of him, that bringeth good tydings, that publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth peace, that bringeth good tydings of good, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth ſalvation, that ſaith unto Sion, Thy God reigneth?</hi> the chief ambaſſadour that anounceth that peace with God, is he that made it. It is the eternal ſonne of God, who by an infinite mercy towards man guilty and miſerable, was pleaſed to allye himſelf with him, by a perſonal union of the divine nature with the humane. He hath taken our nature and imparted his unto us. He hath made himſelfe Man to take upon himſelf the debt of man. For ſeeing that man was indebted to Gods iuſtice, it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170100:18"/>was requiſite that a man ſhould give ſatisfaction. Which becauſe mans nature was not able to find, Chriſt joyning to the Nature and Obligation of man the Nature and Vertue of God, and both in one Perſon, hath fully ſatisfied the juſtice of his father, which required a perfect obedience, and death for puniſhment of diſobedience.</p>
               <p>He hath then preſented to God a moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht obedience, of which the moſt eminent act was to have readily undergone a ſhameful &amp; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death at his Fathers command for the ſins of mankinde, of which he was the pledge and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative; An obedience of infinite merit, more powerfull to obtaine pardon, yea and reward, at Gods hands, then all the diſobedience of the world to incenſe his juſt wrath to puniſhment. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>His owne ſelfe bare our ſins in his owne body on the tree. Iſa.</hi> 53.5. <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes wee are healed. For it pleaſed the father that in him ſhould all fullneſs dwell, and having made peace through the bloud of his croſs; by him to reconcile all things unto himſelfe. Col.</hi> 1.19.</p>
               <p>All that have recourſe to that infinite love of God and that ranſome of ineſtimable value, the merit of his ſonne, embracing it with a true faith, (which cannot act, nor ſubſiſt, without a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) find their peace made with God; their iniquity is pardoned, <hi>they have received of the Lords hands double for all their ſinnes. Iſa.</hi> 40.2. It is a double ſatisfaction, both becauſe it is twice grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170100:19"/>then all the ſins of the world; and becauſe it worketh a double effect, the one to get pardon for ſins, the other to obtain a reward for imputed righteouſneſs. And that ſatisfaction repreſented to God in our faithful prayers makes them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and of ſweet favour, as the incenſe put upon the ſacrifices,</p>
               <p>It is much to be lamented that theſe tydings of grace and glory are but coldly entertained by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eares, as now growne ſtale and vulgar. And that there is more joy for prevailing in a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, and for a Peace that opens the markets and the freedome of commerce after a civil broyle, then for our peace with God through Chriſt, <hi>in whom wee have free acceſſe unto the throne of grace, that wee may obtaine mercy and finde grace to help in time of need. Heb.</hi> 4.16. But he that in the fright of his conſcience hath ſeen hell open, gaping for him, and hath once loſt his thoughts in that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomeleſſe gulfe of miſery and horrour to have his creatour his enemy; if upon that he embrace by faith that great and heavenly meſſage, not onely that his ſinnes are forgiven him by the merit of Chriſt, but that by the ſame merit, of an enemy and a child of wrath he is become the ſonne of God and heire of his Kingdome, his heart will melt with joy love and admiration, and the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſenſe was of his deplorable condition, the greater will his thankfulneſſe be for his gracious reſtoration O the depth of the riches both of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170100:19"/>wiſedome and the goodneſſe of God, who hath found a way to ſet forth together his juſtice and his mercy, and to pardon ſinne by puniſhing it! O the infinite love of the Father, who ſo loved the world that he gave his onely Sonne for them! O the infinite love of that onely Sonne, that ſo loved his enemyes that he delivered himſelfe to a moſt bitter death to give them life and immortality, yea and his own kingdome! O the infinite love of the holy Ghoſt, who ſo loved the world as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce unto them this excellent piece of newes by his word, and ſeale the promiſes of God in their hearts by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beleeveth on him ſhould not periſh but have life eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold then the onely foundation of the peace of the ſoule and contentment of mind! It is that peace made for us with God by his onely ſonne, who hath taken our ſinnes upon himſelfe and in conſequence the puniſhment; giving us in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his righteouſneſſe, and conſequently the reward of it, ſince by it wee appeare righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. This is the ſummary of the Goſpell, This is the onely comfort of the faithfull, <hi>That being juſtifyed by faith wee have peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Rom.</hi> 5.1. Without that perſuaſion all the moral precepts and all the reaſons of Philoſophy cannot ſet the mind at reſt, much leſſe the riches, honours, pleaſures and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes of this world, for who can have peace with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170100:20"/>himſelfe while he is in diſſention with God? And who can have peace with God, but by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his beloved ſonne Jeſus, there being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name under heaven by which wee muſt be ſaved?</p>
               <p>The chiefe impediment of the tranquillity of minde being the remorſe for ſinne againſt God, and the apprehenſion of this juſt and terrible threatning, <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all the words of Gods law to doe them.</hi> Whoſoever embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the merit of Jeſus Chriſt by faith is fenced againſt all the threatnings of the law, and all the accuſations of his conſcience: For to them he will anſwere, As Gods threatnings are juſt ſo are his promiſes; now, he hath promiſt that <hi>if wee judge our ſelves wee ſhall not be judged of the Lord.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. That <hi>he that heareth the word of the ſonne of God and beleeveth on him that ſent him hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſt from death to life. Joh.</hi> 5.24. That <hi>the blood of Jeſus Chriſt the ſonne of God clenſeth us from all ſin.</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. That <hi>he hath blotted out the hand writing of ordinances that was againſt us which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way nailing it to his croſſe. Col.</hi> 2.14. Wherefore theſe threatnings, that God will bring every work to judgement, and that even for one idle word account muſt be given, reach not to thoſe evill workes of which belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have repented and embraced the remiſſion by faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:170100:20"/>
               <p>Thoſe threatenings of judgement doe not reach me, ſince I have already paſt judgemont upon myſelfe by a ſerious contrition, and have received my Abſolution by the merit of him that was judged and condemed for me. If account muſt be given for my ſinnes, Chriſt muſt give it, who charged himſelfe with them But that account is diſcharged, My ſins are put out of Gods ſcore; The curſe of the law to a ſoule that beleeveth in Chriſt, as I doe, is a handwriting taken out of the way, a Bond torne and nailed to the croſſe of Chriſt; God is too juſt to make uſe of a bond vacated to proceed againſt me: the merit of his Sonne which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in payment for me, is of too great value to leave me in danger to be ſued, for the debts which he hath payd; for himſelf was arreſted by Death, the Sergeant of Gods juſtice, and put in that jayle whence there is no comming out till one hath payd the utmoſt farthing; and being come out of that jayle by his reſurrection, he hath made it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that he hath payd the whole debt which he was bound for in our behalfe unto Gods juſtice.</p>
               <p>What though my ſins be great? yet are they leſſe then the merit of Jeſus Chriſt. No ſinne is ſo great that it ought to take away the confidence in Gods promiſes. No ſinne is ſo great that it may damme a ſoule beaten downe with contrition, but toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raiſed by faith and waſht in the blood of the ſonne of God, Indeed the remembrance of my ſins muſt be bitter unto me, yet that bitternes muſt be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170100:21"/>drowned in the joy of my ſalvation, &amp; my repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance muſt be a ſtep not a hinderance to my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. So I will ſay to God every day with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes:</hi> And at the ſame time I will remember that I make that prayer unto <hi>our Father which is in heaven,</hi> who commands me to call him <hi>Father,</hi> to aſſure me that <hi>he will ſpare me as a man ſpareth his owne ſonne that ſerveth him, Mal.</hi> 3.17. &amp; to ſtile him heavenly father <hi>to whom the kingdome and the power and the glory belongeth,</hi> to lift up my hope to that celeſtial glory which he fully poſſeſſeth, and which he will impart to his children in their meaſure. I will walke before God with humility and feare, thinking on my ſins paſt and my preſent weakenes and ſinfulnes; but together <hi>I will goe in the ſtrength of the Lord and make mention of his righteouſnes.</hi> The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of God that frighteth ſinners, comforteth me, and his juſtice is all mercy to me: For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite merit of his Sonne being mine, he is now gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto me in his juſtice. Hereby the peace and aſſurance which I enjoy through faith, is advanced to a joy of heaven upon earth, and to this ſong of triumph. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my ſoule ſhall be joyfull in my God; for he hath cloathed me with the garments of ſalvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteouſnes, as a bridegroome decks himſelfe with ornaments and as a bride adornes herſelfe with her jewells.</hi> This is the peace and contentment of the faithful ſoule that feeleth and reliſheth her
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170100:21"/>bleſſed reconcilation made with God through Jeſus Chriſt. For he that hath peace with God hath peace alſo with himſelfe. And the love of God powerfully growing in his heart by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the bounty of God (whoſe ſweetnes wee may taſte though not conceive his greatnes) breeds there together the peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, baniſheth tumultuous and unlawfull affections, and brings the lawfull under its obedience; ſo that all the affections of the regenerate ſoule meete in one, and make but one, which is the love of God, as many brookes that loſe their names in a great River.</p>
               <p>When the love of God brings not that great peace to the ſoule, and the abſolute empire over the paſſions, it is becauſe love is as yet imperfect; and the cauſe of that imperfection is the deficiency of faith, which doth not yet embrace aright the reconciliation with God through Jeſus Chriſt; and faith is deficient when it is not maintained by good workes, her food, without which it pines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and falls into a ſhaking palſie; and when that foundation is ſhaking, all that is built upon it cannot but be tottering: This then muſt be our firſt and earneſt taske, to make our ſelves ſure of our peace with God by a lively faith, whereby our hearts may be purified from evill workes, and made fertile to all fruits of holineſſe. For hereby we ſhall have peace with our ſelves and ſhall be maſters at home.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:170100:22"/>
               <p>Hereby alſo wee ſhall have peace with Gods creatures, receiving temporall bleſſings as teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Gods reconciliation with us, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very bit of bread wee ſhall taſte his love; Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and adverſity will prove equally good unto us, being diſpenſed by his fatherly care. If God multiply our afflictions it will be onely to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our deliverances. He will never put us to the tryal but to refine our faith, weane our hearts from the world, and make his heavenly comforts more welcome to us; Truly the faithfull ſoule, that knoweth how to make the right uſe of good and evil, ſhall find experimentally the truth of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſentence that <hi>all things are for our ſakes.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.25.</p>
               <p>Alſo this peace with God brings us peace with our neighbours. For he that hath a comfortable ſeeling in his conſcience that God is reconciled with him, will eaſily be reconciled with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, holding it a point of equity, generoſity, and gratefulnes, after that his Maſter hath forgiven him ten thouſand talents, to forgive his fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant an hundred pence. If all men had the peace of God in their hearts, there would be no diſcord in the world. But becauſe moſt men want that good peace, and they that have it, have it but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly, therefore peace between men can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be well cemented. When you ſee men profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing piety and ſound doctrine, tearing and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another with warres or lawfuites, you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170100:22"/>may be ſure that the peace of God rules not in their hearts, ſurely not in the hearts of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and fomentors of diſcord, though they ſhould pretend the zeale of Gods glory, who hath no need of mens turbulent paſſions to advance his kingdome, which is all peace. In heaven where the peace of God abideth in its fulneſs, and filleth the hearts of every one of his Saints, there is alſo of neceſſity a perfect peace between them, for they muſt needs have all one love, ſince they have all but one intereſt, which is the glory of him that loveth them, and for ever glorifieth them with himſelfe.</p>

               <p>HAving ſpoken of the true and onely founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peace of the ſoule and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mind, which is the confidence that God is appeaſed to us through Jeſus Chriſt; Let us now uſe the meanes to preſerve that peace and ſtand firme upon that ſolid ground, beginning by the more general.</p>
               <p>The firſt is to ſerve God with purity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for which this conſideration is eſſential, that our reconciliation with God was made by way of purchaſe, and that when wee were loſt and eſtranged from God, he was pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme us by his Sonne: Wherefore as they that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170100:23"/>bought ſervants expected ſervice from them, God alſo hath bought us to be ſerved by us. That end of our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is thus ſet down by St. <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for us that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelfe a peculiar people zealous of good workes.</hi> It was the cuſtome over all the world in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time to buy &amp; ſell ſervants: As then ſervants could not expect the favour of them that had bought them, unleſſe they did them good ſervice; we that are purchaſed by God with ſuch a great price muſt not expect to enjoy his peace and gracious countenance, if wee doe not ſerve him according to his will; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our utility meetes with our duty, for of the ſervice which wee yeeld unto God the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit reſults unto us.</p>
               <p>Before all things wee muſt looke well that our ſervice to God be pure and ſuch as he requireth; for without that purity all our diligence to his ſervice would be not onely unleſs but hurtfull. One cannot goe to God turning his back to him; The more we labour to ſerve him otherwiſe then he hath commanded, the more wee offend him. The pure way of Gods ſervice is ſet down in his written word, wherein although many places are too high for the underſtanding of the moſt wiſe and learned, yet the things neceſſary for the duty and ſalvation of man, are ſo clearely expreſt, that this commendation is juſtified by experience which David giveth unto Gods word, <hi>The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170100:23"/>of thy Words giveth light, it giveth underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the ſimple. Thy word is a lamp unto my feete and a light unto my path.</hi> It is one of the chief du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods ſervice to reade and carefully medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that good Word, &amp; lend a devout attention to them that announce it. For by it God ſpeaks to us as a father to his children, and none but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural children refuſe to hearken to the voyce of their Father. This duty brings its recompence, for the holy word of God is the glad tydings of the peace of God with men, and the onely doctrine that frames that peace within us. For which reaſon the Prophet would heare it, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 85.5. <hi>I will heare what God the Lord will ſpeake; for he will ſpeake peace unto his people and to his Saints.</hi> To that holy word, as to a ſanctuary, troubled conſciences muſt have recourſe to get the peace of God. Yet the faithfull ſoule ought to be more ſtudious to learne in it, how to pleaſe God, then how to get comfort. Thoſe Chriſtians are yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lower degrees of their regeneration, that practiſe the duties of Gods ſervice only to work their ſalvation. Wee muſt read and hear Gods word for a higher end, even to conforme our wills to the rule of his declared will, and wee muſt think more of his glory then our felicity. If faith in his promiſes make us ſay joyfully with David, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 32 1. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered,</hi> the zeale of his glory muſt make us ſay with more joy and affection, as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170100:24"/>the ſame David, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.1. <hi>Bleſſed are the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in the way who walke in the law of the Lord. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that keepe his teſtimonies and ſeek him with the whole heart.</hi> v. 5. <hi>O that my waies were directed to keepe thy ſttatutes?</hi> v. 7. <hi>I will praiſe thee with upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart when I ſhall have learned thy righteous judgments.</hi> And all along that great Pſalme he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the unſpeakable joy that he took in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and doing Gods commandements; one may ſee that he cannot ſay enough to expreſſe how heartily he was affected to it. If wee love the holy word of God for its own ſake, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe often with it with reverence and affection, becauſe it is the word of our heavenly father, and the declaration of his nature and will, wee ſhall finde our peace in it, though wee ſeeke it not, and get a ſatiſfaction not to be parallelled by any joy for the things of this world.</p>
               <p>To this duty of hearing God ſpeaking to us in his word, the next is to ſpeak to him by prayer, whether it be to implore his grace, or to thank him for his benefits, or to praiſe him for his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite perfection. By theſe two duties of hearing God and ſpeaking to him, we begin in this world that good intelligence and holy communication with God, in which the heavenly peace and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraine felicity of man conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>By prayer wee ſeeke and meete that peace of God which is announced to us in his word and whoſo ſeekes it well, will be ſure to meete it, for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170100:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>to this ſeeking is the promiſe made <hi>Math.</hi> 7.8 <hi>Every man that aſketh receiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this direfull remembrance ſinkes into a conſcience, how man was put out of Paradice, and Cherubims were placed at the gate with aflaming ſword to keepe him out that he may not finde the way to the tree of life, it is enough to ſinke one downe with feare and anguiſh, and make him cry out ſtanding upon the brink of deſpaire, Muſt I be driven away from God for ever, and what way is left for me to returne to the tree of life without which I cannot ſhunne eternal perdition?</p>
               <p>Upon that perplexity Prayer comes and offers her helpe, ſaying, I will bring thee thither, and will goe with thee, without any let of the flaming ſword; for I know a way to the tree of life, where the terrour of the law doth not keep the paſſage; the ſonne of God who is the way the truth and the life, hath made me way unto the throne of grace, to which I goe with full aſſurance to obtaine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and finde grace to helpe in time of need.</p>
               <p>This freedome of prayer to approach unto God was in ſome ſort repreſented by the ſacrifices. That they were figures of prayers wee learne it out of the Pſalme 141 where David beſeecheth God that <hi>his prayer may be ſet forth as incenſe, and the lifting up of his hands as the evening ſacrifice, Pſ.</hi> 141.2 As then the ſmoake of the ſacrifices did mount up toward heaven, which is a way which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170100:25"/>cannot be ſtopt, likewiſe faithfull prayers have at all times a free paſſage to heaven: and although Satan be called the Prince of the aire, he cannot diſturbe them in the way; But, that they may reach to heaven, the incenſe of the merit of Chriſt muſt be layd over the ſacrifice of prayer.</p>
               <p>To that holy duty wee are encouraged by Gods commandement and promiſe. Both are in this text, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50.12. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhall glorifie me.</hi> And ſo in this, <hi>Come unto me</hi> (ſaith Gods eternal Sonne) <hi>all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will eaſe you. Math.</hi> 11.28. None that prayeth to the father through the merit of the Sonne returnes empty; For either he giveth us what we do aſke, or what wee ought to aſke, and that which is fit for us. He that keepeth that holy correſpondence with God is never dejected with ſorrow, or perplexed with feare, for he finds in that divine communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a plaiſter to all his ſores, and an inexhauſtible well of life and joy. David had found it ſo when he ſayd, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16 <hi>I have ſet the Lord allwayes before me, becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved, Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoyceth, my fleſh alſo ſhal reſt in hope.</hi> By prayer wee ground our ſoules in faith, raiſe them with hope, inflame them with charity, poſſeſſe them with patience during our life, and yeeld them to God with joy in our laſt breath.</p>
               <p>To reape theſe benefits by prayer, wee muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170100:25"/>well the right uſe of prayer which is double; It ſerveth to aſke of God our neceſſities both of body and ſoule; for ſince in him wee live and moove and have our being, wee muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſeeke to him by prayer of whom wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually depend. But the nobleſt and moſt proper uſe of prayer is to glorifie God, and converſe with him becauſe wee love him, and becauſe he is moſt perfect and moſt worthy to be beloved; coming to that holy duty, not as a taſke, but an honour, the greateſt honour and delight that a creature can be capable of in this world, ſtealing away from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and companies to enjoy that pleaſant and honorable converſation; as lovers will ſteale away from all employments to entertaine their beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. For what is ſweet in the world in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of this ſweetnes? what is honorable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to this honour to have familiarity with God and be admitted to his preſence at any time, to be received of him as his children, and when wee lift up our affections to heaven the habitation of his glory, to finde that himſelfe is come to meete us in our heart, and hath made it another heaven by his gracious preſence?</p>
               <p>In that meditation a faithfull man will call Gods benefits to minde; and to conceive their excellency to his power, he will from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods grace reflect upon that of his owne naturall condition, ſometimes criminal, miſerable, and Gods enemy; but now through
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170100:26"/>Gods preventing love and unſpeakable mercy changed into the quality of child of God and heire of his kingdome. He hath bin provoked to pity us by the depth of our miſery, wherefore in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wee muſt be provoked to thankfulneſs by the height of his mercy; And this is the chiefe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of prayer, an employment which paying our duty brings our felicity, and though wee have payd but what wee owe, and ſcarce that, giveth us a preſent payment for the duty which wee have payd.</p>
               <p>O what a heavenly delight it is to loſe ones ſelfe in the thought of Gods mercyes, which are beyond all reckoning and above all imagining? and to ſay to him after David, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 40.5. <hi>Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderfull workes, and thy thoughts which are to us ward, they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee;</hi> v.8. <hi>If I would declare and ſpeak of them they are more then can be numbred. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to doe thy will O my God, yea thy law is with in my heart, Pſ.</hi> 86.11. <hi>Teach me thy way, O Lord, I will walke in thy truth, unite my heart to feare thy name. I will praiſe thee O Lord my God, withall my heart, and will glorifie thy name for evermore, for great is thy mercy towards me, and thou haſt delivered my ſoule from the loweſt hell.</hi> Such a converſation with God to rejoyce in his love, praiſe him for his graces, and crave the leading of his ſpirit to walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him unto all pleaſing, is an imitation of the perpetual imployment of Angels and glorified
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170100:26"/>Saints. It is a beginning of the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this life. In it conſiſteth the true peace of the ſoule and the ſolid contentment of minde.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the love of God.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEing entred into the meditation of the love of God, let us ſtay upon it. <hi>It is good for us to be here, let us make here three tabernacles.</hi> And more reaſon have wee ſo to ſpeak in this occaſion, then St. Peter when he ſaw Chriſt tranſfigured in the Mount. For by planting his abode there, he could not have made Chriſt to doe the like, nor given a ſettled continuance to that ſhort bright lightning of glory: But by our meditation upon the love of God, wee make him to ſtay with us, and our ſoul is tranſfigured with him, being filled with his grace and his peace, and already enlivened with a beame of his glory.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the ground the ſpring and the cauſe of the love that wee beare to God, is the love that he beares to us, wee muſt before all things ſtudy to conceive as well as wee may, of the great love of God to us-ward. <hi>Behold what manner of love the father hath beſtowed upon us that wee ſhould be called the ſonnes of God.</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 3.1. This is the principall point of his love, where all other teſtimonies of his love doe beginne and where they end. Without this none can ſay, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170100:27"/>he is beloved of God; For to be the work of Gods hands and maintained by his providence, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all creatures, and to be made after Gods image, and by his liberality to enjoy the plenty and ſervice of nature, is common to all men good and evill: But becauſe creatures without reaſon, and men without goodneſſe beare no love to God, it cannot properly be ſaid that God loveth them, though he be their maker and preſerver. <hi>Love</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the bond of perfectneſſe Col.</hi> 3. Gods love would not be the bond of perfectneſſe, if he loved thoſe things that never return him love; For, that love may be a bond, the two ends muſt meet &amp; knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: now theſe two ends knit, when a creature beloved of God beares a reciprocal love to him. For thereby not onely the man that feareth God joyneth with him, but the whole nature alſo and all the creatures are re-joyned with their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Origine. And whereas ſome creatures cannot, others will not love God, the true child of God, becauſe he gets ſome utility out of them all, yea of thoſe that are Gods enemies, loveth him and gives him thanks for and in the name of all; and ſo by this meanes love proveth a true bond of perfectneſſe, which proceeding from God and knitting with God againe, embraceth and holds faſt together the whole creation, and brings it back to its Creator: A conſideration, which cannot but bring a ſingular content, and a great peace to the ſoule. Being perſwaded of the love of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170100:27"/>God to us whereby we are called the ſonnes of God, we looke upon all creatures as the goods of our fathers houſe, prepared for us. And though others which are none of Gods children enjoy them alſo, yet they are for us; ſince the wicked are for the good, either to exerciſe their vertue by tryals, or even to ſerve and ſuſtaine them; For as the angry waves roaring and foaming about the ſhip where Chriſt was with his diſciples, yet were bearing the ſhip; likewiſe, the enemyes of God and his Church while they are beating and ſtorming againſt it, beare it up in ſpite of their hearts. The agitations of the great ſea of the world, make Gods children more ſenſible of the great love which the Father hath beſtowed upon them, to have given them his beloved ſonne to be in the ſhip with them to keep them ſafe in the ſtorm; and the dangers that overwhelme others, are helps for good unto them that love God. All the deliverances that God ſends them, all the bleſſings that God powreth upon them, they take them as productions of the fatherly love of God who hath adopted them in his Sonne. They taſte that love in the enjoyment of preſent goods, they breath that love in the enjoyment of future &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall goods, they reſt upon that love when they ſleepe, they leane upon that love when they walk, they find that love in all the occurrences of their life; with what face ſoever the various accidents of the world looke upon them, they ſee through
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170100:28"/>them the evident love of God, being certaine that nothing happens to them but is directed by the good hand of their loving Father.</p>
               <p>Theſe pleaſant rivers of the love of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct our meditation up the ſtreame to the great Source, that love which paſſeth knowledge, that myſterious deepe love which the Angels deſire to looke into; whereby of his enemyes that wee were, he hath made us his children, giving for us, even to death, his owne precious Sonne; entitling us, by him, to his eternal glory; and giving us the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of it by his good Spirit crying in our hearts Abba Father. O incomprehenſible love! which hath undergone &amp; overcome death to give us life, and that he might have from us an immortal love!</p>
               <p>That immortal love ought to be the effect of this meditation. So that having conceived to our power how much God loves us, wee may alſo to our power apply our heart to love him; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that all our heart, all our ſoule, and all our underſtanding, is yet too little to returne him love for his love.</p>
               <p>It it true, that this is a debt from which we can never be acquitted, and wee owe it even after wee have payd it: But as this debt muſt be payd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, the continual payment yeelds a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſatisfaction to him that payeth it &amp; oweth it ſtill. For whereas pecuniary debts make the heart ſad, this debt of love makes it glad, when our duty meetes with our inclination, and when
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170100:28"/>wee moſt deſire to dok that which wee are moſt obliged to doe. Beſides, this debt is of that nature that when wee pay it wee make together an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; for although the love began by God he takes it upon him to repay us the love that we pay him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 91.14. <hi>Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Lord) therefore will I deliver him: I will ſet him on high becauſe he hath knowne my name. Pro.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me, and they that ſeeke me early ſhall finde me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But love is due to God, not onely for the love that he hath done us, and for the good that wee hope from him, but for the good that is in him, and becauſe he that is the ſoveraigne beauty and goodnes muſt be beloved in the chiefeſt &amp; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner. All that is beautifull and good in Nature, the glory of the celeſtial bodies, the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the earth, the ſhady greene of trees, the fragrancy of flowers, the variety and utility of animals, the rational inventive vivacity of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual natures, the admirable order of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe both in diſpoſition and conduct; All theſe are ſo many productions of the great bottomleſſe depth of beauty, bounty, power and excellency; and who ſo wiſely conſidereth them, preſently conceiveth that the Authour is poſſeſt of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite perfection onely worthy to be beloved for his owne ſake, and that all the good and beautifull things that he hath done muſt be beloved onely in relation to him and for his ſake. To which if you
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170100:29"/>adde two other points, of which Nature cannot ſufficiently informe us, and wherein the Word of God ſupplies the deficiency of Natures teaching, which are the juſtice and the mercy of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners. O who would not love that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love and excellency, though he had no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his owne in it?</p>
               <p>But how can we barely conſider Gods excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in it ſelfe with an abſtraction of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt? Certainly the conſideration of our concernment will go along, though unſent for, with the contemplation of Gods ſupreme vertue and goodneſſe. And it is impoſſible to conſider God as the onely worthy object of love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conceiving, even with the ſame thought, that our ſoveraigne good conſiſteth in loving him; reputing what a height of honour and content it is when that great Creator, who is all bounty, all beauty, and all perfection, is pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract amity with the creature.</p>
               <p>For in this conſiſteth the great and only excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of man, that God hath given him a nature capable to entertain freindſhip with his Maker: A capacity which being obſcured by ſin is reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him by grace: And God, who as the only abſolute Soveraigne is above all Laws, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended ſo farre to us as to binde himſelfe to the Laws of friendſhip with man, which Laws on his part are moſt inviolably kept; the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in that mutual love is from man.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:170100:29"/>
               <p>As then friends diſjoyned in place are joyned by love, ſo are God in heaven and man upon earth. God indeed is every where, yet God and man are more remote in degree of nature then any two can be in place: But they are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a way farre more excellent &amp; real, for the thoughts of two mortal perſons make no mutual impreſſion, when they are without the line and reach of communication; whereas God is never remote from the faithful ſoul, and they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune together at any time. God makes his love ſenſible to the faithfull ſoul, and ſaith to it by the preſence of his ſpirit, <hi>Soul I am thy ſalvation;</hi> and the ſoul ſaith to him, <hi>Lord thou art my God, I am thine, ſave me &amp; teach me to do thy will.</hi> God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with the ſoul by his word and ſpirit, and the ſoul communeth alſo with God by her word and ſpirit; that is, by prayer and holy aſpirations.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a law of friendſhip that friends bear the one with the other, and that the ſtrong ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the weake. Wherefore God all perfect, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knit a friendſhip with the creature, ſubject as yet to much imperfection, ſupporteth her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects with his love, and covereth her ſins by his righteouſneſſe: Man alſo for his part muſt pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bear, what chaſtenings God layeth upon him, taking all kindly at his hands; for as he muſt be aſſured of his love, he muſt alſo be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly perſwaded of his wiſdom, and beleeve that Gods dealing with him, is all love and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:170100:30"/>
               <p>It is a law of perfect freindſhip that friends declare their ſecrets one to another: So God deals with his freinds; and Jeſus Chriſt uſeth this for a reaſon, why he calls his Diſciples his friends: <hi>John</hi> 15.15, <hi>Henceforth I call you not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for the ſervant knows not what the Lord doeth, but I have called you friends, for all things that I have learned of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi> And Daniel ſaith that <hi>the ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him,</hi> [not the ſecret of his Councel, but that of his Good will towards them, in that which concernes their duty and their ſalvation, which is the ſence of the following words, <hi>and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi>] We then to ſhew our ſelves true friends to him that honoureth us with that title muſt alſo diſcloſe unto him the ſecrets of our hearts: It is true they are open to his all-ſeeing eyes, and if we would hide our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets from him we could not. But God takes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that we give him an account of our ſelves, not that He may be better informed, but that we may be better and happier: for they that diſguiſe themſelves before him are incapable of his grace, and diſſembling is a violation of the lawes of friendſhip. It is the comfort of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that while they confeſſe their ſinnes to God as unto their clear-ſighted Judge, they diſcharge together a duty of friendſhip, declaring to their ſupreme friend their private infirmities and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret diſeaſes, to call upon his help. What benefit
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170100:30"/>we may expect by that free dealing with God, we learn out of <hi>Davids</hi> experience, who ſpeakes thus to God. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.5. <hi>I acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; I ſaid, I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin: For this ſhall every one that is godly pray unto thee, in a time when thou mayeſt be found; ſurely in the floods of great waters they ſhall not come nigh unto him.</hi> Into the boſome of that friend we muſt powre our ſecret ſighes; to him we muſt lay open our moſt intimate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and feares, that we may ſay to him with David, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 38.9. <hi>Lord all my deſire is before thee and my groaning is not hid from thee.</hi> Which as it is true in regard of Gods all-ſeeing knowledge let it be true alſo in regard of our ſincere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſoming of the ſecrets of our ſouls before God.</p>
               <p>Now that the ſecrets of our ſoules and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of our hearts may ever be acceptable in his ſight, and becauſe the heart of man is ſo cloſe and full of windings of hypocriſy, that man himſelf cannot finde the bottom of his own inſide, let us call upon God to aſſiſt us in that ſearch by his good ſpirit, ſaying. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.23. <hi>Search me, O Lord, and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts: And ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have ſincerely laid open before God all that is within us, we have no reaſon to expect the bleſſing of ſerene and innocent peace in our ſoul:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170100:31"/>For God, who is jealous of his glory, takes it as a high contempt when his creature will offer to avoid the all-ſeeing eyes of the Creator; &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he is jealous of our love, taking it as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to the love due to him, when we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to conceale our thoughts our affections and our projects from him. Wherefore the ſence that the conſcience hath of this jealouſy of God, holds her in continual anxiety.</p>
               <p>Whereas he that is true to a reſolution to call God to witneſſe of his moſt ſecret actions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions (as he is whether we will or no) gets two benefits that way: The one, that finding himſelf obliged to impart all that he hath in his heart to God his eternal friend, he will take heed of doing, yea and thinking, any thing that is diſpleaſing unto him, and by his uprightneſſe will prevent the ſhame of opening many impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities before that holieſt of Holies. The other that by this free and open dealing with God he ſhall get a great tranquillity in his conſcience. For, if in humane friendſhips we preſume that by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing the ſecrets of our hearts to a generous friend, we oblige him to love and fidelity, and after that action of freedom we find our heart much eaſed; how great muſt our eaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment be when we have poured all our heart into Gods boſom, that perfect friend, who is truth and ſincerity it ſelf? It is a wiſe part to conceale nothing from God. The only way to poſſeſſe our
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170100:31"/>ſoul with peace and confidence, is to make God our Confident.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a great point of mutual friendſhip to yeeld to the intereſſes and deſires one of another: Herein God hath ſhewed the way to men, having ſo farre condeſcended to the condition and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of men, as to have put on their nature and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their debt upon himſelfe, yea and to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged it: He is dead like men, and for men. And being the ſoveraigne incomprehenſible wiſdome, he deſcends to our capacity to declare himſelf to us, and draw us to him He calls us indeed to denye ourſelves that wee may give ourſelves unto him, but yet how much doeth he yeeld to our deſires and feares? And with what wiſedome and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doeth he ſort his tryals with our ſtrength? And where is the godly man, that hath not found in his foreſt afflictions that kinde uſage that <hi>St Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you but ſuch as is common to man; But God is faithfull who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, that ye may be able to beare it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since then God who is ſo great doeth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelfe with us who are ſo little, the law of reciprocall love requires that wee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate our ſelves with him who is ſo great; that wee diligently informe our ſelves of his will to make it our will; that wee obſerve the things which he loveth that wee may love them, and the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170100:32"/>things which he hateth that wee may hate and avoyd them; that all our intereſſes bow under his, that the end of all our ends be his glory, ſeeking not our owne things but the things of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. Wee ſhall never be our owne, till wee have wholly reſigned our ſelves unto God. Wee ſhall never have a true peace and content within, till our affections be altogether ſubjected to his love, and conformed to his will. But then ſhall wee be peaceable, contented, and maſters at home, when God ſhall reigne within us, and when wee ſhall know no more difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his intereſt and ours.</p>
               <p>Finally, the higheſt point of love being an entire union, and to have all things common, it is alſo the purpoſe and in the end the efficiency of Gods love to us, yea ſo farre <hi>that by his great and precious promiſes wee are made partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 14. and that Chriſt is in us and we in him <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. What hath God reſerved to himſelfe that wee may not call ours? Heaven and Earth are for us, His providence is our purveyour, His Angels are our keepers, His kingdome our inheritance: He gives us his good plenty, his word, his Sonne, his Spirit, his owne ſelfe. Can any be perſuaded of this beneficence of God, and refuſe to give him his body, his ſoul, his intentions and his affections? Shall wee uſe reſervations with God who keeps no good from us? Would any poore man refuſe to have community of goods with a rich man?
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170100:32"/>Now God who is the plenty and felicity it ſelfe will have community of goods with us. Let us embrace the condition readily: Let us give our ſelves, to God, and God ſhall be ours; Or rather ſay wee, God is ours, let us render our ſelves to him: for he prevents us in that Covenant; ſince God is ours, good reaſon wee ſhould be his. Bleſſed we! that wee may ſay with the Spouſe <hi>I am my beloveds and my beloved is mine,</hi> for by that union of perſons and community of goods with God, the ſoul finds her ſelfe arrived to the ſoveraigne degree of riches, peace, glory and delectation.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Faith is a Chriſtian vertue, whoſe moſt proper and natural office is, to embrace that peace made for us with God by Ieſus Chriſt. And by it wee ſigne and ſeale for our part the Agreement made betweene God and man, This expreſſion is borrowed of John the Baptiſt ſpeaking of the Lord Ieſus, <hi>He that hath received his teſtimony hath ſet to his Seale that God is true. Joh.</hi> 3.33. All that we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of our reconciliation with God by Chriſt, &amp; how that reconciliation is applyed to our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is an explication of the duty and benefit of faith; Yet we muſt ſpeake of it againe as a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Love. For the principal &amp; moſt natural fruit of the love of God is to put our whole truſt in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170100:33"/>Thus St Iohn having ſayd much of the love of God to us, and of the love that wee owe him for it, addeth, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.18. <hi>There is no feare in love, but perfect love aſteth out feare, becauſe ſeare hath tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he that feareth is not made perfect in love.</hi> Faith as the mother of all vertues brings forth the love of God, but Love is ſoone eeven with faith, and brings forth her owne mother; For as wee love God becauſe wee truſt in him (as certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of his wiſedome, power and fidelity in his promiſes) ſo wee truſt in him becauſe wee love him, for in all our friendſhips our truſt in the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved perſon followes the meaſure of the love that wee beare to him. He then that loveth God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, truſts in him; And when calamity tempts him to unbeleeving fears, he will obſerve Saint Peters exhortation, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14 <hi>Let them that ſuffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their ſouls to him in welldoing as unto a faithfull creatour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to love well without a good opinion of the perſon wee love, eſpecially of his fidelity and righteouſnes: Seeing then, that God hath promiſed to pardon ſins to thoſe that confeſſe them with a ſerious repentance, if wee love him wee ſhall truſt in his promiſe, that <hi>if wee confeſſe our ſins he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſnes,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. grounding our truſt in his mercy upon his fidelity and righteouſnes: for ſince he promiſt it, certainly he will doe it, he is too faithful to breake his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170100:33"/>word, and too juſt to puniſh us for thoſe ſins of which Chriſt hath borne the puniſhment in our name. This gracious declaration he hath made, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Feare not, little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the kingdome.</hi> Shal wee have ſuch an ill opinion of him, as to think that he hath promiſt more then he was willing or able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; or that, ſince the promiſe made, his will is altered, or his power diminiſht? Let us be ſure that he that loved us from all eternity will love us to all eternity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33 <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifyeth, who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen agnine, who is even ſitting at the right hand of God, who alſo makes interceſſion for us.</hi> And if upon this ſafe ground we truſt in God for the things of the life to come, wee muſt upon the ſame ground truſt his love for the things of this life. <hi>He that ſpared not his own ſonne but delivered him up for us all, how ſhal he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> He that ſaved our ſoules from death ſhall he not deliver our bodies from the dangers of this world? Certainly, he that hath prepared for us eternal delights at his right hand will not denie us our temporal daily bread.</p>
               <p>This aſſurance in his love will ſweeten our afflictions and lay downe our feares, for being perſuaded that God as he is infinitely good is alſo infinitely wiſe, wee muſt in conſequence beleeve that all the evills which he ſends us are ſo many
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170100:34"/>remedies to other evils; that our moſt ſmarting dolours are corroſives applyed by that wiſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to eate the proud fleſh of our corrupt nature; that <hi>he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men, Lam.</hi> 3.33. eſpecially when he chaſtiſeth his children, but is in a manner forced to that courſe by their neceſſity, as when a man is pincht by his beſt friends, to awake him out of a deep lethargy.</p>
               <p>And ſince that eternal friend is every where preſent by his al-ſeeing knowledge and almighty power, and hath promiſed beſides, his gracious preſence to his friends, ſaying <hi>I will not leave thee nor forſake thee;</hi> what reaſon have we of joy &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence at all times, in all places, and in all the occurrences of this life, having God with us all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, obſerving us with his eye, upholding us with his hand, protecting us with his providence, guiding us with his wiſedome, and comforting us with his love?</p>
               <p>The laſt good office that Faith doeth unto us, is in the approaches of death; for then eſpecially it doth repreſent the promiſes of God unto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoule, and ſealeth them afreſh, knitting that bond of perfectnes the mutual love between God and the conſcience faſter then ever: By it God ſpeakes peace unto the ſoule aſpiring to heaven, and makes it ſpread the wings of holy deſires, to paſſe with a ſwift flight from the combat below to the triumph above.</p>
               <p>Faith, bearing up the ſoule in that laſt flight,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170100:34"/>changeth name and nature in the way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes love; to embrace him for ever in glory, in whom we have believed in infirmity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of Chriſtian Hope.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe proper action of Faith is to embrace Chriſt and ground the ſoul upon him; But it hath another action common to it with hope, which is to embrace the benefits obtained to us by Chriſt. Of theſe benefits, the preſent grace is proper to faith, which is juſtification, otherwiſe the Reconciliation of God with the conſcience; the future glory by the contemplation of Gods face, is more proper to Hope.</p>
               <p>Both faith and hope bring a ſweet peace and ſolid content to the ſoul that loveth God. But it is peculiar to hope to adde to that peace a beam of glory; much like thoſe ſpies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that entred into the Land of <hi>Promiſe</hi> before the reſt of the people, to whom they brought ſome of the fruit of the Land; For it entreth into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven beforehand, and from thence brings us a taſte of the promiſed inheritance.</p>
               <p>Hope is the onely thing that puts ſome value upon the life of this world, for all the good of this life conſiſteth in this, that it is a way to a better, and that the earth is the tyring-room of the godly ſoul where ſhe makes herſelfe ready
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170100:35"/>for the wedding of the Lamb. But for that, what were this life good for? It would conſiſt but in two things; to do evill and to ſuffer evill. The very goods of this life without that hope would be evill; for none among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were not ſuſtained by Chriſtian hope, was ever made happy. The wiſeſt of them have ſought the ſoveraigne good out of the objects of the ſenſes, not finding any ſolid content in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall things or actions. <hi>Solomon</hi> wiſer then them all, had found that all under the Sun was vanity and vexation of ſpirit, and under <hi>all</hi> he comprehended intellectual as well as ſenſual things. Neither could any give a more judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous verdict of <hi>all</hi> than he, for he had tryed all things. Where then ſhall we find any thing worth the paines of living, but in Hope? <hi>For if in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. Hope not keeping within the limits of the poor goods of this life liveth already with the life to come, for it looks for the Kingdom of Chriſt which is not of this world as himſelf teacheth us: where although he reigne as a ſoveraigne, he reigneth not as a redeemer; and ſo here is not the reigne of his redeemed. We find it by experience.</p>
               <p>Who ſo then will enjoy the peace of the ſoul and contentment of mind muſt have his hope and his ſpirit in a better place; for why ſhould we expect of the world more then it hath? Can
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170100:35"/>one gather grapes of thornes or figs of thiſtles? May one expect peace of a perpetual agitation, or a durable content from things of ſhort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance? For the ſoul of man being created for permanency, is contented with nothing leſſe then a permanent good; which is the eſſential reaſon why no man could ever find ſatisfaction in the world, there being ſuch a diſproportion between mans ſoul, and the objects that the world preſents to her: for all worldly things are finite, but the ſoul though finite in her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is infinite in her deſire, which nothing leſſe then infinity can ſatisfie. Now it is by hope that the ſoul enjoyeth in this finite world an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good. It is by hope, that we riſe from the dead before we dy, being advanced to a degree of grace that hath already a ſtreak of glory. Of which St <hi>Paul</hi> giveth this high expreſſion. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God. When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appeare then ſhall we alſo appeare with him in glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Worldly hopes flatter us and then diſappoint us. But though they did performe all they promiſe, the preſent poſſeſſion of the beſt things of the world is nothing comparable to the hope onely of heavenly things, even that <hi>lively hope unto which God hath begotten us again by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead; To an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170100:36"/>not away, reſerved in heaven for us.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>O holy and glorious hope, which already makes us partakers of Chriſts reſurrection, and followers of his aſcention, even to the right hand of God! already living with the life of Chriſt &amp; animated by his ſpirit: Bleſſed hope, by which we are preſerved from the general corruption as with a ſoveraigne antidote, and by which we ſubſiſt yea and triumph in afflictions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>taking joyfully the ſpoiling of our goods, knowing in our ſelves that we have in heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance.</hi> It is by hope that we look joyfully upon our bodies decaying with ſickneſſe and age, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Knowing that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from heaven.</hi> It is by hope, that the Martyrs &amp; all that ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſee the crown layd on the top of their croſſe, and rejoyce in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of their Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evill againſt you falſly for my ſake: rejoyce and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven.</hi> By hope we behave ourſelves wiſely in proſperity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. <hi>uſing this world as not abuſing it, for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi> Hope beats down pride, refraines luſt, and weans our hearts from the world.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170100:36"/>Worldly hope diſordereth the ſoul and makes a man go out of himſelf, depending of the future, and loſing the preſent, and is alwayes wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and feaveriſh: But heavenly hope, although it tranſport the ſoul above herſelf, and make her depend upon future goods, ſets her neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in a quiet ſteady frame; becauſe the ſoul riſing to God receiveth God, who makes her his home; ſo that a man by hope, enjoyes beforehand part of the goods which he aſpires unto. Hope groweth like rivers more and more as it draweth neerer the end of its courſe: And when it hath brought the godly ſoul into the Ocean of felicity, there it loſeth the name of <hi>Hope,</hi> and becomes <hi>Enjoyment.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of the duty of Praiſing God.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SInce wee already embrace eternal goods by hope, as wee deſire to beginne now the joyes of heaven, we muſt reſolve to beginne the dutyes of that bleſſed Eſtate. To ſeeke the firſt without the ſecond, would be an ungenerous diſpoſition, and an impoſſible undertaking. If wee apprehend aright that the felicity of man conſiſteth in his duty, and that the glory of the bleſſed Saints in heaven conſiſteth in glorifying God, we will ſeeke in that great duty our felicity, and delight to ſing our part, even, in this life, in the hymnes of thoſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170100:37"/>glorious ſpirits. Nothing gives to the ſoule ſo great a peace, Nothing elevateth the ſoule to ſuch a Paradice, like Joy. The love of God is preferred before faith and hope, becauſe theſe ſeeke their owne good, but that ſeeketh Gods glory; Which to a godly ſoule being much more conſiderable then her owne happines, yet is found to be the ſoveraigne happines of him that ſeekes it before his owne good; Neither is there any more certaine and compendious way to get glory to ourſelves then to ſeeke Gods onely glory.</p>
               <p>In this then the godly man muſt delight, and can never want matter for it, all things giving him occaſion to praiſe God, either for his mercy to his children, or his juſtice to his enemies, or his power and wiſedome eminently ſhining in all his workes, or the infinite perfection that abideth in himſelfe. God hath made all creatures for his praiſe; and none of his material creatures can praiſe him but man onely; And of all men, none but the godly praiſe him: Or if others doe it for company, it becomes them not, neither are their praiſes accepted. Then upon the godly lyeth the whole taſke to praiſe God for other creatures that cannot or will not praiſe him. But that taſke is all pleaſure; as nothing is more juſt, ſo nothing is more delightfull then that duty.</p>
               <p>Look about upon the fields richly clad with the plenty and variety of nature: Looke up to heaven and admire that great light of the world, the Sun
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170100:37"/>ſo wonderfull in his ſplendour vertue and ſwift neſſe: When he is ſet, looke upon the gloryes of the night, the Moone and the ſtarres like ſo many bright jewels ſet off by the black ground of the ſkie, and ſetting forth the magnificence of their maker. See how ſome of them keep ea cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine diſtance among themſelves, marching toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the leaſt breaking of their ranks, ſome follow their particular courſes, but all are true to their motions, equal and infallible in their regulated periods.</p>
               <p>Then being amazed and dazelled with that broad light of Gods greatnes and wiſedome, let every one make this queſtion to himſelfe, Why doeth God make me a beholder of his workes? Why among ſo many different creatures hath he made me one of that onely kinde, to whom he hath given reaſon to know and admire the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a will to love him, &amp; a tongue to praiſe him? Is it not that I might render him theſe duties in the name of all his other workes? And to this duty I am obliged by the lawes of thankfulnes, ſince all theſe other workes are for me; good reaſon then that I ſhould be for God, lending my tongue and my heart to the whole univerſe to love praiſe and bleſſe the great and good authour of this rich and beautiful Nature. O the greatnes, the goodnes, the wiſedome of the incomprehenſible Creatour? And among all his attributes manifeſted in this admirable workmanſhip, O how his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170100:38"/>are over all his workes? How every part of this great work is compleat? How all the parts are well ſorted together, helping and ſuſtaining one another with a wiſe Oeconomy? O if the worke be ſo perfect what muſt the workman be? If the ſtreames be ſo cleare what muſt the ſource be? Upon theſe if wee fix our meditation with a holy attention wee ſhall heare that ſpeech which St <hi>John</hi> heard being rapt up in ſpirit. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.3. <hi>I heard</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, ſaying, Bleſſing, honour, glory, and power, unto him that ſitteth upon the throne and unto the Lambe for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From Nature looking to Providence, let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how notwithſtanding the oppoſition of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual malices and the preverſneſſe and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, yea and by theſe very things, God advanceth his glory, maintaineth his truth, and formeth a ſecret order in confuſion. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his decrees a Million of engines are ſet on work ſubordinate or co-ordinate among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, wherby things moſt remote yet meet in the order of cauſes to produce the effects appointed in Gods counſel. Where the chief matter of wonder is, that many of theſe cauſes are free agents, which doing what they will, bring forth moſt part of the time that which they will not, and by the uncertainty of their giddy agitations ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the certain End determined by God. Who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170100:38"/>can comprehend the innumerable multitude of the accidents of the world, all written in Gods Book, and diſpenſed by his providence, that infinitely capacious and ever watchfull wiſdom, ever in action, though ever at reſt; which by the order he gives to the greateſt things is not diſtracted from the care of the leaſt? He makes the heavens to move, and the earth to bear, and diſpoſeth of peace and warre in the world, and of the ſubſiſtence and revolution of Empires. Who would beleeve, that at the ſame time he tels the number of our hairs, and that not ſo much as one ſparrow falls to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſpeciall appointment, but that we are told it by his own mouth, and that our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence aſſureth us of his care of the leaſt of our actions and accidents of our life? Here wee muſt reſt amazed, but not ſilent; for our very ignorance muſt help us to admire, and extoll that depth of the riches both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God, whoſe eye and hand is in all places, whoſe ſtrength ſuſtaineth, whoſe providence guideth all things, and taketh as much care of each of his creatures as if he had nothing elſe to looke to.</p>
               <p>If our minds be ſwallowed up in the depths of Gods wiſdome, this one depth calls in another deep, which brings no leſſe amazement but gives more comfort, &amp; that is the fatherly love of God to us his children. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18. <hi>O the bredth, the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170100:39"/>length, the depth, the heighth, of the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge!</hi> the bredth that embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Jewes and Gentiles, having broken the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall, to make a large room to his wide love, that <hi>his way might be known upon earth, his ſaving health among all Nations. Pſalm</hi> 67.2. The length, which hath elected us before the foundation of the world, and will make us live and reigne with himſelfe for ever. The depth which hath drawne us out of the loweſt pit of ſorrow &amp; death; &amp; to effect that, hath drawn him down to that low condition. The height, which hath raiſed us up to heaven with him, and makes us ſit together with him in heavenly places.</p>
               <p>With what miracles of mercy hath he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his Church from the beginning of the world? How many graces doth he poure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeveral members thereof, nouriſhing our bodies, comforting our ſouls, reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from iniquity by the gift of repentance and faith, keeping off the malice of men and evill Angels from us by the aſſiſtance of his good Angels, delivering our life from death, our eyes from teares, and our feet from falling.</p>
               <p>But before and after all other benefits, we muſt remember that principal benefit never ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remembred. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Giving thankes unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the inheritance of the Saints in light; who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſſe, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170100:39"/>hath tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Sonne; in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveneſſe of ſins.</hi> This is the higheſt top of our felicity, the main ground of the peace of the ſoul, and the incomparable ſubject of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of our minds; Yea, if we have ſuch a deep ſence of that heavenly grace as to praiſe God continually for it with heart and mouth. For as we praiſe God, becauſe he bleſſeth us, he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us becauſe we praiſe him; and by his praiſe, which is the eternal excerciſe of his bleſſed Saints we become already partners of their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their peace, and their joy.</p>

               <p>ALl that we have ſaid hitherto regardeth the Principal cauſes (both the efficient and the inſtrumental) of the peace with God. There are other cauſes which of themſelves have not that vertue to produce that great peace, yet without which, it cannot be preſerved nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced neither; theſe are, a good conſcience, and the excerciſe of good workes. Not that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation made for us with God by the merit of his Son needs the help of our works, but becaus the principal point of our reconciliation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is, that we are redeemed from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is done by the ſame vertue that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemes us from Hell, and by the ſame operation:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170100:40"/>For it is a damnable ſelf-flattery and ſelf-deceipt for one to beleeve that he is reconciled with God, if he feele in himſelfe no converſion from that naturall enmity of the fleſh againſt God, neither can he enjoy a true peace in his ſoul.</p>
               <p>In that reconciliation God makes uſe of our wil; for in all agreements both parties muſt concur and act freely. And to make us capable of that freedome, God by his ſpirit looſeth the bonds of our unregenerate will, naturally enthralled to evill. But it will be better to medle but little with the worke of God within us, and looke to our owne; learning the duties which wee are called unto as neceſſary, if wee will enjoy that great reconciliation.</p>
               <p>The firſt duty is to walke before God with a good conſcience, for in vaine ſhould one hope to keepe it tranquil and not good: Conſcience is the natural ſence of the duties of piety and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, warning every man (unleſſe he be dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into a beaſt) to depart from evil and doe good; And a good conſcience is that which obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſenſe and warning. But the ordinary uſe, which I will follow, by a good conſcience under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands onely the firſt part, which is, to beware of evil.</p>
               <p>This good conſcience is ſo neceſſary for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of that peace of God applyed to us by faith, that the A poſtle to the Hebrewes requires it that

               <p>By a conſcience that condemnes us not, wee muſt not underſtand a conſcience without ſinne, for there is none ſuch to be found; Much leſſe a conſcience that condemneth not the ſinner after he hath ſinned, for the beſt conſciences are thoſe that forgive nothing to themſelves, and paſſe a voluntary condemnation upon themſelves before God, by a free and penitent confeſſion: But the good conſcience that condemnes us not, according to St <hi>Johns</hi> ſenſe, is, that which beares witnes to a man to have walked in ſincerity, and cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him to have ſhut up his eyes (ſince his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion) againſt the evident lights of truth and righteouſnes, or to have hardned his heart againſt repentance after he hath offended God.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:170100:41"/>
               <p>The godly man will remember that the peace betweene God and us was made by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, whereby God gives himſelfe to us in his Sonne, and we give our ſelves to him. If then any refuſe to give himſelfe to God, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, God will not give himſelfe to him, and ſo no peace, for every contract muſt be mutual. When the one party offereth to ſigne and ſeale, and the other refuſeth it, there is no agreement. Whoſoever then will covenant with God and enjoy his peace, muſt to his power keepe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cleare from all willful violations of the conditions of the agreement; For, ſince this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is often termed in Scripture a mariage, our ſoule which is the ſpouſe of Chriſt muſt give her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to him as Chriſt gives himſelfe to her, elſe the mariage is voyd, for it is the mutual conſent that makes the mariage.</p>
               <p>Whereupon one may ſay that God is more good then wee are wicked, and that while wee breake the contract, God remaineth faithfull, and leaves us not every time that wee leave him. Truly, there is great need of that, otherwiſe this ſpiritual mariage would ſoon end in divorce: But you know that when the faith of matrimony is violated betweene huſband and wife, although they be not divorced, love decreaſeth on both ſides; what remaines of it, is ſowred with jealous grudges, and peace dwells no more in that houſe.</p>
               <p>It fareth ſo with us when wee violate the faith
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170100:41"/>and love which wee owe unto God, by doing that which is diſpleaſing unto him; God doeth not preſently give us the Letter of divorce, and his conſtancy ſtands firme againſt our ficklenes; but he diſcontinueth the inward teſtimonies of his love, and his peace recedeth from us; then wee dare no more ſeeke our delight in him, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde it any where elſe; paſtimes make us ſad, and when wee take the aire, and ſhift place to find eaſe, we are not eaſed, becauſe we carry our burden along with us, a ſad weight upon our heart, a boſome-accuſer within; we come to the duty of prayer againſt ſtomack, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from it without comfort.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that the eternal covenant of God cannot be diſanulled by the ſins of men, as St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>unbeleefe of the Jewes could not make the faith of God without effect. Rom.</hi> 3.3. But I ſpeak not here of the eternal decree of God, but of the offer made of his Covenant unto the conſcience, by the word of God, and his ſpirit, which covenant many lightly embrace and then break it having not maturely conſidered before, upon what conditions it was offered.</p>
               <p>Who ſo then will keep the peace of his conſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and his confidence with God, muſt carefully keep himſelfe from all things that diſpleaſe his holy eyes, and turne away his gratious countenance; leſt when our need or our duty calls us to draw neere him by prayer, we feele
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170100:42"/>our ſelves pulled back by a guilty feare. Let us walk in his preſence with ſuch ſimplicity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity that at all times we may ſay with <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 26.5. <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency, and compaſſe thine altar, O Lord; That I may publiſh with the voice of thankſgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works: O Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy houſe.</hi> See what ſerenity, what liberty of Spirit he had got by his innocency: He goeth ſtreight to the Altar of God, he rejoyceth in his praiſe, he delighted in his houſe, he will chooſe it for his habitation. Evill conſciences are not capable of ſuch a freedom with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> in this Text alluded to the forme of the Sanctuary, which had a Laver in the entry, where the Prieſts before they came neere the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar were to waſh themſelves: We alſo, that we may keep our free acceſſe unto Chriſt our Altar, muſt waſh our hearts in innocency; If we go not through the laver, we miſſe our way to the Altar: St. <hi>Paul</hi> regarded this Figure when he ſaid, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I will, that men pray every where lifting up pure hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that to lift up our hands pure unto God we have need to waſh them in a better inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency then our own, and the pureſt have need to be waſht in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> himſelfe having ſaid that he would <hi>waſh his hands in innocency, Pſalm</hi> 26. and ſoon after, <hi>but as for me I will walke in mine integrity;</hi> immediately upon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170100:42"/>that prayeth to God <hi>to redeeme, and have mercy upon him.</hi> Yet God requires our innocency, which he examines as a gratious Father not as a ſevere Judge; he lookes more to the ſincerity of our hearts then the perfection of our actions, give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his peace to the penitent ſoules void of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile;</hi> That walketh before God with feare, knowing his infirmities, and together in confidence knowing Gods mercy and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his promiſes; That hath no evil end, and corrupteth not his good ends by evill wayes; That chooſeth rather to miſs the advancements of the world then to ſhrink back from his duty to God, ready to ſuffer the loſſe of all things that he way keep him. That lookes upon his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral goods without remorſe, becauſe among them he ſeeth nothing ill gotten; and upon his neighbours goods without envy, becauſe he hath taken the Lord for his portion <hi>who is rich to all that call upon him. Rom.</hi> 10.12. His words agree with his heart, and his actions with his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He brings his affections captive under the the feare of God, boweth his will under Gods will, and makes all his ends to ſtoope un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the intereſt of Gods glory. Hee that doth theſe things ſhall never be moved: Whatſoever becomes of his temporal condition (which is better ſettled by integrity then by all the tricks of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170100:43"/>the craftieſt pates) he ſhall poſſeſſe a firme, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, equal and tranquil ſpirit; He ſhall have peace in warre, and calme in the ſtorme, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that no evil can befall him ſo long as he is well with God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of the exerciſe of Good works.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO have a holy and tranquill conſcience, it is not enough for us not to do evil; we muſt do good. Theſe two dutyes may be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, but not ſevered. He that doth no good, of neceſſity doth evill; for it is ill done, to do no good. God made us not onely that we ſhould not ſinne (For that, it would have bin ſufficient to have given us the nature of plants or ſtones) but he hath given us an intelligent active nature, that we might uſe it to know, and love, and ſerve our Maker. And ſince he made us after his image (for which reaſon <hi>Adam</hi> is called the Son of God <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.) if we wil be like our Father which is in heaven we muſt ſtudy to do good, for he doth good continually, even when he ſends evill, which he makes an inſtrument of good, whether it be for juſtice or mercy. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 26.10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth;</hi> and ſuch all our pathes ſhould be.</p>
               <p>To this we are more eſpecially called by our redemption whereby we are reſtored into the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170100:43"/>right of Gods children which we had loſt, and are purchaſed to be his ſervants. God did not adopt us that we ſhould be idle children: Chriſt did not purchaſe us that we ſhould be unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervants.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the life of man is laborious and allwayes in action, we learne out of Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to examine all our works ſeverally and joyntly, to ſee whether they be good, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce when we find them ſo. Thus God ſaid, <hi>Let the light be, and the light was, And God ſaw that the light was good.</hi> The like after the workes of every day of the firſt week. And in the end of the creation God made a review of all that he had done; <hi>And behold all was very good;</hi> to ſignifie that God ſeeing all his works good and compleate took great delight in them, and did remunerate his own actions with the ſatisfaction which he he took in his owne wiſdom and goodneſſe. That we may then imitate God, let us do nothing but good; and againe when we have done it, let us ſee how good it is: Though it cannot be but very defective, yet if we find in it ſincerity and an ingenuous deſire to do good, we may in our meaſure rejoyce as God did for doing good, and ſhall enjoy a ſweet peace within repreſenting both in the good that we do and in the delight that we take in well doing, the image of him that hath created and adopted us to expreſſe his likeneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:170100:44"/>
               <p>Our confidence in God by the merit of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sonne is the ground of true peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. But that confidence is fed by works. By faith we beare teſtimony to our hearts that we are reconciled with God, and by workes we beare teſtimony to our faith. As, by the reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we know that a man is alive, and by the ſame reſpiration the man is kept alive: So, the exerciſe of good workes is together the marke of faith, and the way to maintaine that ſpiritual life.</p>
               <p>As God hath wiſely ordered that the actions neceſſary for the preſervation of naturall life ſhould be done with delight; likewiſe, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of good workes whereby the life of faith is maintained gives a ſingular pleaſure unto the faithfull ſoul. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40.8. <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God,</hi> ſaid <hi>David.</hi> And the Lord Jeſus could ſay that <hi>his meat was to do the will of him that ſent him: John</hi> 4, 32. Wherefore as healthful bodies eat their meat with appetite, ſo godly ſoules ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves with a holy appetite to good workes. In both, it is an inward ſence of neceſſity that provokes the appetite, it being as impoſſible to live with the life of faith without good works, as to keep the body alive without meat or drink. And, as theſe ſatisfy the ſtomack, good actions give a ſweet ſatisfaction to the ſoul. But as one cannot live alwayes in the ſtrength of one meale, but muſt take new food every day, elſe the body will pine away, and die in a ſhort time; likewiſe,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170100:44"/>the uſe of good workes muſt be daily: too much intermiſſion will abate the pulſe of faith; trouble will get into the conſcience, or a heavy numneſs, which will end in the extinction of ſpiritual life, unleſſe the appetite of doing good worke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>For this exerciſe, the Lord Jeſus gave us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that wee ſhould follow his ſteps; Who did good in the whole courſe of his life, and more in his death; Who ſpent the night in prayer, and the day in healing the ſick and converting ſinners: Who for ill words returned ſaving inſtru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>; Who overcame contempt with humility, and adverſities with patience: Who did good to them that perſecuted him to death, healing the eare of Malchus that was come to take him, and praying for them that crucifyed him! Who to obey God his ather deſpiſed his owne life, denyed the love of himſelfe, and made this free and miraculous ſubmiſſion to God in the terrours of death, <hi>Father, not my will but thy will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The joy and glory which he got by that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion muſt encourage his Diſciples to preferre the obedience to God and the duty of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before all intereſſes; being ſure that to forſake them for God is the way to preſerve them, and that by ſuffering for his glory, wee get glory.</p>
               <p>The content that accreweth to the ſoule by tending carefully Gods ſervice and loving nothing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170100:45"/>like it, cannot be expreſt but by thoſe that feel it. How great was St Pauls ſatiſfaction when he ſayd 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12 <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not in fleſhly wiſedome, but by the grace of God, wee have had our converſation in the world.</hi> And how ſweet was his rapture of joy, when he ſayd being neere the end of his race, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith; Henceforth there is layd up for me a crowne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes which the Lord the righteous judge ſhall give me.</hi> O what pleaſure is comparable to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good conſcience! The joy of a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour who hath newly got an imperial crown, is not comparable to St Pauls happines when he rejoyced to have fought the good fight of faith, and ſtretched himſelfe towards the crowne of righteouſnes layd up for him. Increaſe of worldly goods increaſeth ſorrow. When they are above ſufficiency, inſtead of eaſing the minde they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it. Worldly pleaſures are ſhortlived, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behinde them an unpleaſant <hi>fare-well,</hi> and often a ſting of crime. Worldly honour is winde, which either will blow a man downe, or puff him up with an unſound tumour. But godlines and good actions give a ſincere joy, a ſolid content a laſting peace, a ſatiſfaction penetrating to the inmoſt of the ſoule. This is richly expreſt by Iſaiah in prophetical termes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.10 <hi>If thou draw out thy ſoule to the hungry, and ſatiſfye the afflicted ſoule,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170100:45"/>then ſhall thy light riſe in obſcurity, and thy darknes be as the noone day. And the Lord ſhall guide thee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and ſatiſfye thy ſoule in drought, and make fat thy bones; and thou ſhalt be like a watered garden, and like a ſpring of water, whoſe waters faile not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although Devotion, and good conſcience, and the practiſe of good workes, were ſad things, as the world imagineth them; yet ought wee to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe that ſadnes in this life of few dayes, to make proviſion for the other life which is eternal, ſince this life is a moment on which eternity depends; And wee ſhould <hi>ſow in teares to reape in joy:</hi> But ſeeing that a good conſcience active in piety and good workes gets thereby, even in the preſent, a ſerene peace and a heavenly comfort not credible to any but thoſe that feele it; is it not a great incouragement to doe well, That the way to make us happy, is to make us ſaints?</p>
               <p>It is none of the leaſt arts of Satan for turning men away from the practice of godlines and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions, to repreſent Devotion and vertue with an auſtere habit and a ſowre face, enough to make children afrayd, and growne men alſo, many of them having with a gray beard a childiſh underſtanding, <hi>authoritatem ſenum, vitia puerorum.</hi> But certainly this is a falſe ugly vizard ſet upon a handſome and gracious face; there being nothing more ſerene and pleaſant then godlines and a good conſcience. A good conſcience is that merry heart which is a continual feaſt. To doe Gods will
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170100:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>with a good will keepes a mans heart cheerefull to God, and pleaſant to himſelfe. Will you then make your hope ſure of an eternal reſt, and of thoſe pleaſures for evermore at the right hand of God? Doe but take the firſt courſe to make your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves content and joyfull in this life which is to walke before God unto all pleaſing to your power and to be rich in good workes.

               </head>
               <p>Wee have meditated upon the peace of God and the way how to get it in our ſouls, and keepe it. That peace brings a golden ſerenity and a ſolid content to our hearts. But becauſe the godlieſt perſons in this world are ſubject to ſinne, and by ſinning to trouble that peace and ſerenity, it is neceſſary to redreſſe ourſelves often by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Of that duty I have ſpoken in the third chapter of this firſt booke, as the neceſſary way to embrace by faith our reconciliation with God, and a maine part of the great worke of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. But after wee are reconciled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, wee are men ſtill. Neither is any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſo great in this life as to roote out ſinne altogether out of mans nature. Whoſoever then
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170100:46"/>will preſerve his integrity and peace (for theſe two commonly goe together) muſt have this warning continually in his mind, Lét him that thinks he ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. And if he fall, let him take up himſelfe preſently by a godly repentance. The more he eſteemeth himſelfe advanced and confirmed in piety, the more let him miſtruſt himſelfe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the temptations of Satan. For after holy, reſolutions and elevations of zeale and devotion, great ſins very often are committed; becauſe then the conſcience is moſt ſubject to relent, as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confident of her good eſtare; Much like beſieged ſouldiers who after a brave ſallie will remitt of their watchfulnes, deſpiſing the enemy whom they have beaten, and in their ſecurity are taken by ſurpriſe. Conſcience will fall aſicepe, but Satan never ſleepeth, and never miſſeth to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our negligence. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> By ſaying <hi>us,</hi> he comprehends himſelf acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the moſt perfect are eaſily beſet by ſin.</p>
               <p>Some ſins are preſently felt, and leave a ſting as the Scorpion doth; To that ſting the remedy muſt preſently be applyed by repentance, and a faithfull recourſe to Gods mercy through Chriſt; alſo the aſſiſtance of his Spirit muſt bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored, elſe the venome will ſpread, and the wound become mortal. Other ſins are leſſe felt, or creep in undiſcerned, yet leave a heavineſſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170100:47"/>upon the heart, and make it ſlower to godlineſſe and good workes. Then the buſineſſes of the life intervening, the remembrance of many ſins will ſlip out of our memory, which nevertheleſſe worke their effect upon the conſcience, blunting the ſenſe of piety, and ſetting the ſoul further from God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is the part of a wiſe Chriſtian often to reviſit the ſtate of his conſcience, call himſelfe to account, and by a pious ſolicitude of repentance pick and ſift out even the leaſt duſt that ſticks to us of the worlds uncleanneſſe and our own, ſcowring out that ruſt which conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, like iron, will contract, if it be not often handled.</p>
               <p>If the uncleane ſpirit will not dwell in a mans heart unleſſe he <hi>find the houſe empty, ſwept, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, Matth.</hi> 12. that is, void of all goodneſſe and furniſht for his turne; We muſt not expect that the holy Spirit will dwell in our heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we beſtow our beſt care to ſweepe it for him, emptyed of the immundicities of ſinne, &amp; to garniſh it with holineſſe. He will not keep houſe under the ſame roofe with the unclean ſpirit. And unleſſe we ſpeedily put that enemy out of doores, God may in his diſpleaſure leave him the whole houſe. Whereas if you keep it ſwept for God with daily repentance, he will make it his Temple, and ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.14. <hi>This is my reſt for ever, here will I dwell, for I delight in it.</hi> But
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170100:47"/>that our hearts may be cleane habitations for him, we have need to call for the aſſiſtance of his grace. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. <hi>Create in us a cleane heart O Lord and renew a right Spirit within us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the Son of God honours us ſo much as to call us his friends, let us religiouſly obſerve the lawes of friendſhip with him. Even in humane friendſhips, if we have ſometimes the misſorutne to give offence to one whom we eſpecially love and reſpect, we cannot be at reſt till we have given him ſatisfaction. And ſhould we be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent as to neglect God our great friend, after we have offended him? Shall we let the Sunne go down upon his wrath and our offence? Let us returne to him without delay, and humbly ſeeke his peace. The ſpeedieſt reconciliations are the beſt.</p>
               <p>In this returne to God, which muſt be every day, let us call to our remembrance all the ſins of late date, and others of elder date not ſufficiently repented of, confeſſing them to God with contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and craving pardon for them with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and faith through the merit of his Sonne, which to all repenting ſinners is an exhauſtible ſpring of mercy, open at all times. <hi>Zechariah</hi> meant this by that <hi>Fountain opened to the houſe of David and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for ſin and for uncleanneſſe.</hi> And becaure many treſpaſſes of ours are out of remembrance, and ſome we have run into without our knowledge, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170100:48"/>God with <hi>David</hi> to clenſe us from ſecret faults, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.12. and that he be pleaſed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thoſe ſins which we have forgotten.</p>
               <p>To that daily returne to God, ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary returnes muſt be added, where faſting and alms be joyned to prayer. Thereby theſe clouds ſhall be cleared off, which trouble the ſerenity of the conſcience, and the ſoul ſhall get a great help to rejoyce in the love of God and glory in his bounty.</p>
               <p>When one is come to that bleſſed ſtate of the ſoul, he muſt wipe off the teares of repentance and drowne that ſadneſſe in a thankfull joy. For the ſorrow of repentance is good by accident on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe there is ſome evill to be healed. It is like a medicine which gives gripings and diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eteth nature, therefore not to be uſed but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover health: Although we cannot repent too much to have offended God, there may be exceſs in the ſorrow of repentance. To ſeek merit or oſtentation in penitent ſorrow, which is the face that vulgar ſoules give to devotion, is making a glory of the matter of our ſhame, as if a fellon had the ambition to weare the halter about his neck with a good grace. The ſorrow of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is an ill paſſage which we muſt of neceſſity go through, if we will be ſaved; but we muſt not make that paſſage a dwelling place. After we have uſed it to make our peace with God, we muſt be comforted and rejoyce in that peace. For
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170100:48"/>God hath not called us to ſorrow, but to peace and content; And the Goſpell is the Doctrine of peace and aſſurance.</p>

               <p>We have ſpoken in the firſt Book of the ground and principal cauſe of our inward peace which is alſo the end and perfection of the ſame, and that is our Union with God. We have treated alſo of the meanes altogether divine and effective of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170100:49"/>that end, which are the love of God and our neighbour, faith, hope, and a good conſcience active in good workes. We intend now, with Gods helpe, to ſpeake of thoſe ſubordinate cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and meanes, where Prudence is a ſervant of Piety, to keep peace and good order within. In this great work the handmaide ſhall often need her Miſtriſſes help; for reaſon not ſanctified by piety is as dangerous to uſe, as Antimony and Mercury not prepared.</p>
               <p>The two great workes of ſanctified reaſon to keep inward peace and content, are theſe; Not to be beaten down with adverſity or corrupted with proſperity, going through both fortuns with vertuous cleare and equal temper, making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of all things, and fetching good out of evill.</p>
               <p>To frame that golden temper in our minde, we muſt lay downe before all things for a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Maxime, That all the good and evill of mans life, though it may have its occaſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, hath truly and really its cauſes within us; excepting onely ſome few caſualties where pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath no place; and yet there is no evill but may be either prevented, or leſſened, or turned into good by a vertuous diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>Hence it followes that not without but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us our principal labour muſt be beſtowed, to take an order for our peace and content. To keep us from falls in a long journey, if wee would ſend before to remove all the ſtones out
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170100:49"/>of the way, we ſhould never have done; but the right courſe is to get an able and ſurefooted horſe and to ſit faſt on him. It would be a more impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble undertakeing in the wayfairing condition of this life to remove all temptations and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of our way; but againſt theſe two ſorts of obſtacles, we muſt provide a firme ſpirit, able to go through all, and ſtumbling at nothing; but keeping every where a ſure and eeven pace.</p>
               <p>To that end let us acknowledge within us two generall cauſes of all our content and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and all our order and diſorder: The firſt cauſe is the Opinion that we conceive of things; The ſecond is, the Paſſion moved or occaſioned by that opinion. Take a good order with theſe two cauſes, you ſhall be every where content, tranquil, wiſe, and moderate. But from the diſorder of theſe two cauſes, proceeds all the trouble of the inward polity of our minds, and all the miſrule and miſery that is in the world.</p>
               <p>It muſt bee then our labour to order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right theſe two Principles of our good and evill within us, and in the order here ſet down, which is eſſential to the matter; Imploying this ſecond Book to get right Opinions of the things of this world, from which men uſually expect good or evill. And this will prepare us matter for the third Book, whoſe task will be to ſet a rule to paſſions. For that which ſets them upon diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly motions is the wrong opinion wherewith
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170100:50"/>the mind is poſſeſt about the objects. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever can inſtruct his mind with right opinions, may after that, rule his paſſion with little labour.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Said that things exteriour are the occaſions of the good and evill of man, but the cauſes of the ſame are the interiour, Opinion and Paſſion. Now to treat of the cauſes we muſt alſo treat of the occaſions, as ſubjects of the opinion, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the paſſion; Not to examine them all, for they are as many as things in the world and accidents in mans life; there is none of them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether indifferent to us, but are conſidered either as good or evill. We will ſtay onely upon the chiefe heads, and endeavour to finde the true price of things that men commonly deſire, and the true harme of thoſe things which they feare.</p>
               <p>In this ſearch, I deſire not to be accounted par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, if I labour to give a pleaſant face to the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt things. It is my profeſt intention. For my work being to ſeek in all things occaſion of peace and content, why ſhall I not, if I can, borrow it even from adverſity? And is it any whit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial whether I find it indeed or deviſe it, ſo I can make it ſerve my turne! Is it not prudence for one to be ingenious to content himſelfe, yea though he coſen himſelfe to his owne content?
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170100:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>My readers may beare with me if I uſe them as I uſe my ſelfe, who, next to the care of pleaſing God, make it my chiefe ſtudy to content my mind, and in all the ſeveral byaſſes that God puts upon the rouling courſe of my life, ſtrive to behold all accidents by the faire ſide; or to give them one in my mind, if they have none. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I hope to juſtifye the ingenuity of my dealing, to ingenious mind, and ſhew that I give no falſe colours to evill things to make them looke good. For ſince the good and evill of moſt things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in opinion, and that things prove good or evill as they are taken and uſed, if I find good in thoſe things which others call evill, they become good in my reſpect. It is the great worke of wiſe men to turne all things to their advantage, ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exteriour things to their mind, not their mind to them, <hi>et ſibi res non ſe rebus ſubmittere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This truth then ought to be deeply printed in minds, ſtudious of wiſdome and their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, That they beare their happineſſe or unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe within their breaſt; and, That all outward things have a right and a wrong handle; He that takes them by the right handle, finds them good; He that takes them by the wrong indiſcreetly, finds them evill. Take a knife by the haft it will ſerve you, take it by the edge it will cut you.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that all ſublunary things are of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded nature; Nothing is ſimple, nothing but may do good, nothing but may do harme. And
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170100:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo in moral goodneſſe or badneſſe. There is no good thing but is mingled with evill: There is no evill, but ſome good enters into the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſame truth holds in all perſons, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and events. Out of the worſt, a well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed mind endowed with the grace of God, may extract good with no other chymiſtry then piety wiſdom and ſerenity.</p>
               <p>It lyeth in us, as we incline our minds, to be pleaſed or diſpleaſed with moſt things of the world. This may be exemplifyed in things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and of leſſe importance, which may be preſidents for things ſpiritual and of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. One that hath fed his eyes with the rich proſpect of delicate Countryes as <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Anjou,</hi> where all the beauties and dainties of Nature are aſſembled, will another time take no leſſe delight in a wild and rugged proſpect of high bare mountaines, and fifty ſtories of ſteep rockes, as about the <hi>grand Chartreuſe,</hi> and the bottome <hi>Ardennes,</hi> where the very horror con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the delectation. If I have bin deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee the trees of my Orchard, in ſpring bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed, in ſummer ſhady, in autumne hung with fruite; I will delight againe, after the fall of the leafe, to ſee through my trees new proſpects which the buſhy boughes hid before; and will be pleaſed with the ſight of the ſnow candied about the branches, as the flowers of the ſeaſon. This is better then to conſider in deſerts nothing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170100:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>but their hideouſneſſe and barrenneſſe, and in winter nothing but the rheumatique weather.</p>
               <p>If a facile and well compoſed mind take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in theſe varieties of nature, why not in the varietyes of his condition? When he is rich, he will delight in the ſervice of his men; When he falls to poverty, he will delight to help himſelfe, finding that he is the ſooner obeyed and more to his minde. If he hath children, he will delight to provide for them; If God take them from him, he will rejoyce that they are provided for. If he obtaine a beloved woman, he finds his content increaſed; If he miſs her, he finds his care di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſht. If he be neere his friends, he injoyes gladly their love and preſence; If he be farre from them, he ſeeth no more their diſtreſſes. One time he loves health, becauſe it makes life ſweeter; Another time he will love ſickneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will bring a happy death. That mans patience was ingenuous, who having put out his eye falling upon his own ſtaffe, gave God thanks that his ſtaffe was not forked, ſo he might have put out both his eyes with that fall.</p>
               <p>There is nothing where a well inſtructed minde may not find matter of ſome content and comfort. A truth preſuppoſed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he teacheth to <hi>rejoyce evermore,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.16. <hi>yea and glory in tribulations. Rom.</hi> 5.3. For when God multiplyeth his tryalls to his children he makes his comforts to abound much more. Of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170100:52"/>which they deprive themſelves who in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes look onely upon the ſad ſide, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious to vexe themſelves. The occurrences of this life having many faces, a wiſe man will alwayes entertaine the beſt. And in my opinion it ſhould not be a hard matter to obtaine of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to give alwayes ſentence in our own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>Yet this muſt be uſed with ſome diſtinction. For in thoſe evils which conſiſt in our own fault, we muſt alwayes conſider the evill as great as it is, and give ſentence againſt our ſelves; for the way to be abſolved of God is, to condemne our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before him. In that caſe he that is againſt himſelfe doth much for himſelfe. But as for the evills that come to us by accident or by the fault of another, wee muſt alwayes leſſen the evill and be partial for our ſelves through humility, meekeneſſe, patience, yea and forgetfullneſſe; for ſo ſhall we give judgement in our favour, the milde part being that which muſt worke our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Whereas he that aggravates evils with his imagination, and makes his ſpite, and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of revenge to be as hammers to knock in deeper the arrowes that are ſhot againſt him, gives ſentence againſt himſelfe, and takes part with his enemies to work his own diſcontent.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations muſt be further inſiſted upon in their proper place. I uſe them here on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as inſtances of the benefit of opinion when it is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170100:52"/>well taught, and the harme of the ſame when it followes a wrong information.</p>
               <p>To get a right Opinion, the contemplation by which <hi>Epictetus</hi> beginnes and grounds his Book, of moſt rare excellency, muſt be maturely and diligently ſtudied. For if we beſtow but a little Chriſtian dreſſe upon it, it will be a perpetual &amp; infallible rule for the right valuing of all things, and ſo will prove a ſingular help for the cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and tranquillity of minde. Here it is.</p>
               <p>In the univerſality of things ſome are in our power, ſome are not: Such as are in our power are Opinion, appetite, deſire, averſion, and all our inward and outward actions [By our power I meane not our meere naturall power, which is weak and prone to evill, but the regenerate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtrengthened with Gods grace, which aſſiſting our natural freedom gives it <hi>both to will and to do according to his good pleaſure. Phil.</hi> 2.13. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chriſtian hath more power over his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, paſſions, and motions then <hi>Epictetus,</hi> who had but the natural power.] The things that are not in our power, are money, glory, empires, and generally all things that are none of our workes.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things that are in our power are free by their nature, and cannot be hindred by any but our ſelves, or at leaſt without our conſent: For although the world and the Devill ſeduce our opinions and tempt our affections, they cannot
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170100:53"/>get any victory over us, unleſſe we lend our hand to it. But as for the things that are out of our power, they are weake, ſubject to ſervitude, expoſed to oppoſition and hinderances, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of the power of another.</p>
               <p>We muſt then hold this for certain, that if we take things ſubject to ſervitude, to be free; and things that depend of another, to be ours; we cannot but meet often with oppoſitions and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in our deſignes. We ſhall lament and torment our ſelves, we ſhall accuſe men, and murmure againſt God. But if we account that onely to be ours which is ours indeed as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, and look upon all that depends not of us as being nothing to us, we can loſe nothing, we ſhall not afflict our ſelves for any thing in the world, the ſpoyling of worldly goods that are about us ſhall not wrong or deject us, for that cannot be taken from us which is none of ours.</p>
               <p>That conſideration will do us great and good ſervice in this Treatiſe. And to beginne, let us make uſe of <hi>Epictetus</hi> his diſtinction for the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the principal things about which we have need to rectifie our opinion, that we may be wiſe and tranquill every where.</p>
               <p>The things that depend not of us are either the goods of fortune (as they are called) which are riches, honour, friends, and family; Or goods of the body, as beauty, ſtrength, health, pleaſure and life it ſelfe; As theſe things depend not of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170100:53"/>us, no more do their contraryes, poverty, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, enemyes, loſſe of friends, deformity, paine, ſickneſſe and death. When one hath thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer at will, that ſtate is called proſperity the latter, paſſe under the name of adverſity.</p>
               <p>The things that depend of us, or rather of the grace of God in us, which becomes the beſt part of ourſelves are piety, honeſty, wiſedome, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and their contraries depend of us, alſo, yet with ſome dependance from outward agents, the world and the Devill.</p>
               <p>There be other things of a mildle rank, which partly depend of us, partly not, and therefore are ours onely in part, as learning and capacity where induſtry and diligence may do much, but nothing againſt or without nature, and they are loſt by age and ſickneſſe, and other outward cauſes.</p>
               <p>Let us review this order with more leaſure, and weigh the price and inconvenience of each thing; for without that, it is impoſſible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves about them with a judicious tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. We beginne with things belonging to proſperity.</p>

               <p>OF things that depend not of us, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from us are the goods of fortune; The
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170100:54"/>goods of the body are neerer, for our body is the houſe of our minde, which is our trueſelfe, and whoſe goods are properly ours. Yet ſuch is the imprudence of men, that they are moſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy about that which is moſt remote, and neglect that which is neereſt and moſt eſſential to them; for the goods of the body, neglecting thoſe of the minde; and for the goods of fortune, neglecting thoſe of the body; They will forfeit their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to pleaſe and ſerve their body, and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard their body to get or preſerve the goods of fortune. Whereas they ſhould follow a clean contrary order, hazarding and neglecting their body, if need be, for the good of the mind, and the goods of fortune for both. [Here I ſay once for all, that by fortune I underſtand not blind chance, ſince Gods providence rules all, but the exteriour of a mans condition as it is diſtinct from thoſe things which properly belong to the body and the mind.]</p>
               <p>So farre I will comply with the humour of the world as to ſpeak of riches in the firſt place, for it is that they ſeek before all things, ſhewing by their actions, which alwayes muſt be beleeved rather then words, that they hold it the firſt and chiefe good. <hi>Pecunia ingens generis humani bonum.</hi> An errour, that hath provoked ſome to oppoſe it with another errour, ſaying that money is the root of all evill. St. <hi>Paul</hi> decides the difference, ſaying that <hi>the love of money is the roote of all
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170100:54"/>evill;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. the love of money, not money it ſelfe. It is not wealth that doth the miſchiefe but the weakneſſe of men that cannot wield it, coveting it with greedineſſe, purchaſing it with wicked wayes, imploying it in unjuſt actions, keeping it with trouble, and loſing it with deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire.</p>
               <p>Riches are good, but in the loweſt rank of all goods; for they have no place among laudable goods, there being no praiſe to be rich; Nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong goods deſirable for their own ſake, for they are deſired becauſe of other things. It is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but cuſtome and fancy that giveth price un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gold &amp; ſilver, inſtead of which ſhells are uſed for commerce in ſome part of the Eaſt Indyes. But for fancy, a barre of Iron would be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then a wedge of Gold.</p>
               <p>In one point, as indeed in all other reſpects, money is inferiour to other goods, as health, honour, and wiſedome; that whereas one may enjoy them by keeping, and increaſe them by uſing, one muſt loſe his money to enjoy it, and part with it to uſe it.</p>
               <p>But in two things eſpecially the imperfection of riches is ſeen; that they ſatisfye not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and that in the greateſt need which is the redemption of the ſoul, they are of no uſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a hindrance.</p>
               <p>True goods are thoſe that make the poſſeſſors good, which riches do not. They are indeed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170100:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>inſtruments of good in the hands of thoſe that can uve them well; But they are inſtruments of evill, in the hands of thoſe that know not how to uſe them. And the number of theſe laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greater by farre, riches do much more evill then good in the world. They ſtirre up folly, luſt, and pride, and open a wide gate to wickedneſſe, yet themſelves not wicked of their nature. To a well compoſed and diſpoſed minde they are excellent helps to vertue, for they afford meanes for good education and matter for good actions. Wiſedome and riches together is a faire match. The rich and wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes thus of it by his experience, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Wiſdome is good with an inheritance, and by them there is profit to them that ſee the Sunne, for wiſedome is a defence, and money is a defence, the excellency of knowledge is, that wiſdome gives life to them that have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The French verſion of that Text ſaith that <hi>Riches cover the owners,</hi> So they do, but it is as the ſhell covers a ſnaile, for they are a heavy toile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome luggage, wherewith a man can advance but ſlowly, and without which he cannot goe; And if they ſhelter him from ſome injuries, they expoſe him to other; they provoke envy, and are a faire butt for fraude and inſolency: So to go one ſtep further in the compariſon; that ſhelter may be broken upon a mans back, and he cruſht under it.</p>
               <p>To know the juſt price of riches, reckon what
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170100:55"/>they coſt both to get and to keepe, what paines there is to get them, what danger and care in the keeping, what unſatisfaction in the enjoying, what uncertainty in the poſſeſſion; <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.6. for <hi>they make themſelves wings</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) which no humane art can clip; A thouſand accidents, which no prudent forecaſt can prevent, make them ſuddenly flee away. The worſt is, that they diſtract the minde from the true goods; for they that have got them and poſſeſſe them moſt innocently, if they will preſerve them and keepe them from ſinking (which they will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do) muſt apply their mind to them, and much more, if they will increaſe them. Which interpoſition of the earth cannot but eclipſe the cleare light of the minde, and hide heaven from the ſight of the ſoul. This made the Lord Jeſus to ſpeak this ſentence confirmed with an oath and a repetition. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.23. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdome of heaven. And againe I ſay unto you, It is eaſier for a Camell to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> And truly although riches of themſelves be not evill, but be as the minde of him that poſſeſſeth them is, good to him that uſeth them well, evill to him that uſeth them ill, yet the Devills haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of gold mines, and places where money and plate is hid, gives a probable ſuſpition that the Devill ſticks by riches, and breatheth upon
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170100:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>them the aire of his malignancy.</p>
               <p>Let every wiſeman conſider whether he will beſtow for them as much as they coſt, that is, whether he will weary his body, vexe his minde, offer violence to his conſcience, bring his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoul captive under the things of the earth, &amp; be diverted from ſeeking the goods which are onely permanent and true to them that have them once, to runne after deceitfull goods which are none of ours even when we have them; of which the keeping is uncertaine, and the loſſe certaine, though we might avoide the ordinary daingers, whereby fooliſh rich men deſtroy their wealth, and their wealth deſtroyes them.</p>
               <p>The juſt meaſure of riches, is, as much as one needs for his uſe, for that which is above uſe, is of no uſe. How they muſt be uſed we ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when we treat of Paſſions. Here we ſeeke onely to know their price.</p>

               <p>In time of peace it is wealth that brings nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and greatneſſe; In time of warre it is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: for, by invaſions, high titles and royalties of Lordſhips had their beginning. We may then value Nobility by its cauſes, for wealth hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing praiſe worthy, and it is the origine of new Nobility: Invaſion is meere Injuſtice, &amp; it is the Origin of ancient Nobility ſo much cryed up.</p>
               <p>There is a natural Nobility conſiſting in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, and a nobility by grace which is our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption to the right of Gods children; Theſe two together make a man truly noble. Civil nobility is nothing in nature, and conſiſteth meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the opinion of men and cuſtome of nations. We deduce it from maſculine ſucceſſion, but in ſome Kingdomes of the Eaſt they derive it from the feminine, becauſe every one is more certaine of his Mother then his Father. In <hi>China,</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not extraction, gives nobility. In ſome places
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170100:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>nobility conſiſteth in merchandize. In ſome the military profeſſion, in ſome in leading an idle life. Which different cuſtomes ſhew that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nobility lyeth altogether in fancy, and in effect is nothing.</p>
               <p>Yet ſuch as it is, it proveth a goodly ornament to Vertue; it is like enamell which being of ſmall value ſets off the luſter of Gold. It addeth grace facility and power to vertuous actions. Many vertues are obſcured or altogether hid by pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and meane condition. Sobriety in a poore man is imputed to indigence, continence to want of power, patience to baſeneſſe. But theſe vertues become illuſtrious and exemplary, when humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity meets with greatneſſe, and temperance with power; Vertue then ſhines when it is ſet in a high Orbe, where a man takes for the meaſure of his deſires, not what he can, but what he ought to do,. A right good man, being high and rich, hath great helpes to do good, and power prompts him both with the occaſion and the deſire.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, when greatneſs and meanes meet with a weake and perverſe ſpirit, it doth harme in the world. And ſuch are moſt men, whoſe vicious affections appeare not when they are kept under by poverty &amp; obſcurity, but when they riſe, their vices will riſe with them. As Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans ill ſet, and ill tuned, ſhew not their defect while the bellowes lie down unſtirred; but when
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170100:57"/>the winde is blowne into the pipes, they gall the eares of the hearers by their diſcord and harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Likewiſe many vices lie mute and quiet, till the winde of honour and plenty get into them, and blow up an ill compoſed minde with audaciouſneſſe, raſhneſſe, and diſcordance with himſelfe, which riſeth too high with pride, and together falls too low by miſerableneſſe, and where all is out of tune by luſt, inſolence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance.</p>
               <p>But even thoſe that were evill before, unleſs they have conſtant minds, and throughly dyed with piety, will bee corrupted by honour and plenty. For all men whom wee call good are prone to evill, and no greater invitation to evill then facility.</p>
               <p>And if great honour (which is never without great buſineſſe) doth not corrupt a man, it doth interrupt him; and as it gives him meanes to do good, it takes off his mind from thinking of it, and many times binds his hands from doing that good which he intends, by reaſon of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of buſineſſe and ſeveral inclinations of men which he muſt accommodate himſelfe unto; it being certain the greater a man is, the more he is a ſlave. And it is in the higheſt condition that a man hath moſt reaſon to ſay after St. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 7.19. <hi>The good that I would I do not, but the evill which I would not that I doe.</hi> One is conſtrained to court thoſe whom he deſpiſeth, favour thoſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170100:58"/>whom he feareth, ſhut his eyes many times to ſee neither vice nor vertue, till one uſe himſelfe in good earneſt to preferre conveniency before righteouſneſſe; There a mans life is a continuall Pageant of diſſimulation, which he knowes in others, and returnes it to them, who alſo know it in him, yet both parties put on the face of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and kindneſſe over an arrogant and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous minde, and embrace thoſe whom they would have choaked.</p>
               <p>There alſo when a man would do good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, very often he doth harme to himſelfe. To advance one mans ſuite he muſt put back and diſcontent many, and get ten enemyes for one friend, who will leſſe remember the good office, then the others the injury which they think to have received by the repulſe. Truly high places are not fit for true friendſhip, for they take away the freedome from it, and by conſequent the ſweetneſſe and the right uſe. In the throng of buſineſſe and companie, the mind loſeth its tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; And many times after one hath loſt his reſt he loſeth his labour alſo. It is a great miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a man to be never his own, and to have no time to think of God, of which when one diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth the uſe, he loſeth in time the deſire of it, and too many acquaintances make one a ſtranger with God: <hi>Paucos beavit aula, plures perdidit; Sed et hos quoque ipſos quos beavit perdidit.</hi> The Court advanceth but few perſons, and deſtroyeth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170100:58"/>many but even thoſe which it advanceth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth and ſpoyleth; for moſt men as they grow in height decreaſe in goodneſſe, and many times in eſtate; like ſquibs which conſume them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they aſcend.</p>
               <p>It is in few mens choice, whether they may be great or no, ſome being borne to it and obliged by their birth to maintaine their condition. Others being borne farre under it, and there kept by invincible neceſſity. Yet among great and ſmall, ſome ſtill are in poſſibility to raiſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and come to greater place. And whereas it is in the choyce of few perſons whether they ſhall be great, it is in the choice of all, whether they will be ambitious, and aſpire to high and nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious places. Let a wiſe man conſider whether honour be worth as much as it coſts to get and to keep; whether hee would loſe his reſt for it, leave converſing with God to converſe with men, runne the danger to become wicked to become great, and among the juſtlings of envy be alwayes ready to fall and break his neck. Let him weigh in the ſcales of a right judgement the reſpect and Opinion of others, againſt ſo much perſonal care, perill, and loſſe.</p>
               <p>A middle degree of quality, enough to ſtand a little out of the dirt, is commodious and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The degrees above and beneath are ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. But a wiſe and pious man finds liberty and nobility in any degree.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of Glory, Renowne, Praiſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FRom the honour that attends greatneſſe and riches we paſſe to that which is deferred to Vertue, or that which beares the name of it. For this ſecond ſort of honour many generous ſpirits have contemned the firſt, and greatneſſe, and riches, and life too; dying willingly that they night have glory, when they ſhall be paſt having any thing in this world.</p>
               <p>Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>a good name is rather to choſen then great riches, Prov.</hi> 22.1. <hi>And better then be precious oyntment, Eccl.</hi> 7.1. The goodneſſe of it lyeth in ſome facility that it gives to do good, for when mens minds are poſſeſt with a good opinion of a perſon they are ſuſceptible of his counſels. Thereby alſo a man may better his condition.</p>
               <p>The content that a good action gives to the doer is a real and ſolid good, but the content that the reputation of it giveth, is vaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull: If the Renowne be for vaine things, ſuch as moſt things are in the world, it can yeeld but a contentment like itſelfe, and though it be raiſed by real vertue, yet reputation is but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and the Opinion of others; It is hollow meat, and who ſo will feed upon it will ſoone be like that hungry Dreamer of whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>who dreames that he is eating, but he awakes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170100:59"/>and his ſoul is empty. Iſa.</hi> 29.8. A wiſe and good man lookes for a better reward of his vertue then the talk of the world. No action is good if it be don for praiſe, or if approbation be ſought of any but God and ourſelves. <hi>John</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>which receive honour one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God onely?</hi> Our actions ought to be ſuch as to be of good ſavour, before the world, elſe they can do no good in the world: But that good ſavour muſt be ſought as an acceſſory, not a principal, and muſt bee rejected, when inſtead of an acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory it becomes a hindrance and a barre from the the principal, which is the glory of God and a good conſcience: Let that witneſs beare teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to our ſelves, and let men ſay of us what they will. My Opinions and Affections if they be good, make me good and happy, not the Opinion of my neigh bours.</p>
               <p>A wiſe man muſt ſubject reputation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not himſelfe to her. If he can make her runne before him as his Harbinger, to prepare for him an accommodation whereſoever he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and get him a roome in the judgements and affections of men, it will be a prudent courſe. And it will be a point of prudence not to hunt reputation too eagerly: for Reputation is well compared to our ſhaddow, ſhe fleeth from us when we run after her, and runnes after us when we run from her. She will go more willingly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170100:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>where you would have her, if ſhe go not of your errand but of her ſelfe, and doth better ſervice when one thinkes not of her. If ſhe be deſired it is for ſomething elſe; but to court her for her owne ſake, it is more then ſhe deſerveth. A vertuous man will diſdaine to do ſo much, when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth that ſhe is more apt to ſpeak of frivolous then ſerious matters, and will many times put a gloſſe of praiſes upon evill things. What a coyle doth <hi>Roman</hi> antiquity keep, about that harebrain'd girle <hi>Clelia</hi> for ſtealing a horſe out of <hi>Porſena's</hi> Campe, where ſhe was an hoſtage, and foording a River none of the greateſt to returne to her Mothers chimney-corner? For that action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the publique faith, raſh, ungenerous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and eſpecially immodeſt in a mayd, her ſtatue on horſeback was publiquely ſet in the Market place, and fame is trumpetting her praiſe to the worlds end. It were eaſy to name many both of old &amp; late date, that have got reputation at a very eaſy rate. How many famous men are like boyes crackers, that give a great report with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect? How many toyes are talked of and extolled, while grave workes are buried in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? Since Fame hath trumpets, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſhe fills them with winde; that goeth farre and faſt by its leightneſſe, and is fit to make a noiſe. But a ſolid vertue makes little noiſe, and the tongues of the vulgar do ſo much for her, as to let her alone.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:170100:60"/>
               <p>The Renown of great and good things advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth but ſlowly, but recompenceth her ſlownes by her long laſting. But even in that long laſting there is vanity, for what benefit is it for vertuous men deceaſed, that the world ſpeakes of them two thouſand yeares after their death? Are their ſoules more glorious for it in heaven? Are their bodies the leſſe cold in the grave? Yet for that hope of an outliving uſeleſſe renowne gallant men will climb up a breach through a thick haile of musket ſhot and granadoes, that the world may ſay of them, Theſe gentlemen are dead in the bed of honour: O brave men! It is pitty that theſe praiſes make not theſe brave men to riſe from the dead for joy, preſerve not their fleſh from wormes and putrefaction, and make no roſes nor violets grow upon their graves. Well let us pay them that praiſe which they have ſo deare bought. O brave men! But let us ſay alſo, O the folly of men, who having fed themſelves with vanity in their life time, will not end their vanity with their lives, but ſeek to perpetuate it by their death.</p>
               <p>It were ſtrange that praiſe ſhould do good to the dead, ſince it doth more harme then good to the living. For one that is encouraged with praiſe to do well, a thouſand are thereby puft up with pride. It is hurtfull to weak ſpirits and troubleſome to the ſtrong. If praiſe were a real good, every one ought to praiſe himſelfe, as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170100:61"/>one feeds himſelfe. And none ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to heare or ſpeake his owne praiſe, for none ought to be aſhamed of good things. That ſhame, is a proofe either that praiſe is not good or that it belongs not to us.</p>
               <p>This deſerveth a deeper conſideration. Glory and praiſe among men are of thoſe ſhades and images of divine attributes ſcattered in this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour world; of which ſhades the ſubſtance and reality is in God. Glory in him is a ſubſtance, yea his owne eſſence, and to him alone all Glory belongeth. The ſparkes of glory that are in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are rayes of that ſoveraigne ſplendour. Now theſe rayes go not ſtreight like thoſe of the Sunne, they go round and fetch a compaſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the principle of their being. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 145.10. <hi>All thy workes ſhall praiſe thee O Lord, and thy Saints ſhall bleſſe thee.</hi> Since his works praiſe him by nature, his Saints muſt praiſe him by will. Thoſe ſtreakes of glory that are in his creatures, as comming from him, muſt returne to him by nature or by will. For although man be not able to give any glory to God by praiſing God, yet God knoweth how to receive from us that glory which we cannot give him, and to make himſelfe glorious in his owne workes.</p>
               <p>Here is then the reaſon why men are deſirous of praiſe and glory, and yet are aſhamed of it: Their deſire of it is a natural ſence that it is good; And that they are aſhamed of it, is another
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170100:61"/>natural ſenſe that it was not made for them. Wherefore a wiſe Chriſtian will deſire and ſeeke the glory of God: And when ſome image of that glory is given him by the prayſes of men, hee will preſently bring that praiſe and glory to God as Gods proper goods, ſaying, Glory is a Crown that was not made for my head, and on my knees I put it on the head of him to whom it properly belongs.</p>
               <p>Such is praiſe in its Original and End, both which do meet; but being conſidered in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour cauſes and conveighances, as it comes from and through men, it is a tide of popular applauſe, as ſubject to go downe as to come up, conſiſting in fancy, expreſt in talke, riſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſmall cauſes, and upon ſmall cauſes falling againe. We muſt make more of our content then to pinne it upon ſuch an uncertain poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; never reckoning among our goods a thing lying in the Opinion of another, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the poſſeſſion of the perſon that gives it, for humane praiſe belongs not to him that is praiſed but to him that praiſeth, ſince every one is or ought to be maſter of his Opinions and words. They that give us praiſe retaine it in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and may take it from us when they pleaſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the goods of the Body, Beauty, Strength, Health.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FRom the goods of Fortune which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of us and many times conſiſt in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, we come to the perſonal: beginning by thoſe of the body.</p>
               <p>The firſt is Beauty, which among bodily goods may be called the firſt gift of God, and the firſt advantage of nature. I ſay not, that it is the principal, for health is farre above it in excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But it cannot be denyed that it is the firſt, ſince God hath placed it in the entry, and on the front of this building of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Beauty at the very firſt meeting winnes the good Opinion of beholders, and gives an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious preconceit of a faire mind. Beauty is a ſigne of goodneſſe of nature. The ſweet vigour of the eyes, the ſmoth skinne, the lively white and red, the handſome lineaments of the face, and the comely proportion of the body are markes of a quick and well compoſed mind. Which yet is not peculiar to Beauty: For many perſons in whom melancholy is predominant, which tanneth their skin, ſets their eyes deepe in their head, &amp; puts a ſowreneſs on their brow, have a penetrating and judicious underſtanding. Open faces, which are the moſt beautiful, have commonly candid and ſerene ſoules, but none of the craftieſt.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:170100:62"/>
               <p>The obſervation that Pride is a companion to Beauty is not naturally true, but by accident; for beautifull perſons being praiſed and admired of all, who can wonder that they grow proud, ſince ſo much paine is taken to make them ſo?</p>
               <p>A good preſence is well ſorted with valour and wiſedome, and doth excellent ſervice to brave men, if they ſpoyle it not by affectation.</p>
               <p>Beauty is the loadſtone of Love; which courts her and calls its her faire Sun. And ſo ſhe is, for it gets heat by Beauty. And as the heat cauſed by the Sun is allayed when the Sunne is ſet, ſo doth the heat kindled by Beauty loſe its flame when Beauty its gone. When love outlives Beauty, ſome other cauſes muſt keep it alive, as vertue and utility.</p>
               <p>Beauty is among deſirable goods, not among the laudable; for nothing is laudable in us but the productions of our will and induſtrie. For which reaſon handſome women ought to reject prayſes of their Beauty; for either theſe praiſes are inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to God, who as the Author ought to have the whole praiſe of his work; or they are injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them, and ſeeme to preſuppoſe that they have made their beauty, and ſophiſticated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by art; for none ought to be praiſed for that he hath not done.</p>
               <p>Great and rare Beauty in its nature is deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but by accident; and as the world goes, it is more to be feared then deſired, and does more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170100:63"/>harme then good. It is hurtfull to the perſon that is endowed with it, for it expoſeth her to temptations and inſolence, which commonly make her wicked and miſerable. It is hurtful to the perſon that woeth it or enjoyeth it, for it ſets him as a marke for injuries. Many might have led a tranquil life, and eſcaped diſcredit, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, ruine, and ſtabbing in the end, had not their wives bin too handſome.</p>
               <p>But though beauty were not cumbered with all this danger, the nature and price of it muſt be well conſidered, that we may not expect of it a contentment beyond its kinde. Beauty is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour and ſuperficiall ornament of a ſickly and mortall body, the inſide whereof is unpleaſing to the eye, and would make the hearts riſe of the admirers of the outſide if they could ſee it. It is a faire bloſſom onely for the ſpring of life, which will fade with age, or wither with ſickneſſe and cares, in the very ſpring. It is a cheater, which promiſeth much, &amp; keepeth not promiſe, for the moſt amorous never found in it a delight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the deſire that it kindleth. Take the right meaſure of the goodnes of that ſo much deſired poſſeſſion of beauty, ſo ſhal you not deſire it above meaſure; and when you have it, you ſhall reape from it a more ſincere content, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſhall require of it as much as its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affords, and no more.</p>
               <p>Strength alſo and Health are things deſired,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170100:63"/>not laudable, as things that come by nature, not by will.</p>
               <p>Great ſtrength of body is commonly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a weake minde; and that diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is augmented with much feeding, and obligeth nature to beſtow the maine Magazine of ſpirits upon diſgeſtion diſtribution of meat, and hardning of the brawnes of the limbs, to enable them for ſtrong labour, leaving but few ſpirits to attend reaſoning &amp; contemplating. Speak to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall hunters, of the delight of ſpeculation; you ſhall finde them little more capable of it then their hounds, which are the higheſt point of their meditation. To their minde is very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient the definition which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives to the Soul, <hi>that it is the firſt act</hi> (that is the principle of the motion) <hi>of an organical body;</hi> for their ſoul ſeemes to be made for no other end but to move their body. It is certain that too great excerciſe of the body dulls the mind. The preheminency of man above beaſts conſiſteth in reaſon, and the capacity of knowing and loving God. Men that are proud of their ſtrength, <hi>robore corporis ſtolidè feroces,</hi> placing their advantage and content in a thing wherein they are inferiour to many beaſts, deſcend from their dignity and take place under their natural ſubjects. He that with his forehead would knocke a great naile into a poſt, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry head, deſerved this praiſe, that next to a Bull he had the hardeſt head of all beaſts.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170100:64"/>
               <p>Health of all goods of the body is moſt to be deſired, yea more then life; A truth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by the knowne Maxime, that the end is better then the meanes, for I hold not health to be ſubordinate unto life, but life unto health. Being is the meanes, and well being is the end. <hi>Non eſt vivere ſed valere vita.</hi> So <hi>Mecenas</hi> muſt be left to his owne Opinion &amp; deſire, who though he were maimed hands and feet, and had all his teeth looſe in his head, and a bunch on his crooked back, would think himſelfe well, if he had but life; Yea if by enduring the ſharpeſt tortures of the croſs he might keepe life he would willingly endure them. His enemies could wiſh him no greater harme, then to buy life at that rate.</p>
               <p>The body being made for the ſoul, the true natural benefit of Health is not long life, but the liberty of the actions of the mind. For the minde ſtickes ſo to the body that it cannot act very freely in a body tormented with acute paine, or pined with a lingring diſeaſe. Wherefore that we may go through that neceſſary captivity as eaſily as may be, an eſpecial care muſt be had of the health of our body; taking all occaſion from it, of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the exceſſes &amp; ill government of the minde, for the corruption and inflammation of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; behaving ourſelves with our body, not as living for it, but as unable to live in the world without it. Our minde was made for a better end then to ſerve the fleſh. Yet let us give it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170100:64"/>faithfully its due, as to the horſe that carryes us in our journey: It muſt be fed and tended, elſe it will faile us in the way.</p>
               <p>Curious perſons commit two faults about the care of their bodies. They beſtow much coſt and labour to adorne them, but they neglect their health, expoſing themſelves halfe naked to cold aire to ſhew a fine halfe ſhirt, as if they furniſht their roomes with rich hangings, and ſuffered the raine to fall on them for want of repairing the roofe. In matter of cloathes, health and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity are the beſt counſellors, not the eyes and Opinions of ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>Health muſt be acknowledged the richeſt jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell of all temporal things, yea preferable to many ornaments of the minde. He that hath got much learning in the Tongues, and hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed his body with watching, hath loſt more then he hath got.</p>
               <p>But the healthfulleſt body of the world is a tottering houſe which muſt every day be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derpropt with food, and (for all our care) will fall in the end.

Such as it is, it muſt be put in the rank of thoſe things that depend not of our will, and therefore muſt not be accounted ours, but uſed as a borrowed commodity.

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of bodily Pleaſure and Eaſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OF all arguments of meditation there is none where writers ſhew leſſe ſincerity then in this. Every one blames pleaſure and eaſe, and yet every one ſeekes it. They tell us that it is the cauſe of all evill, that it poiſoneth the paſſion, that it blindeth reaſon, that it is an enemy to good counſell, aad that it is impoſſible for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to ſtand with Volupty; Yet the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, love their eaſe, and their very diſcourſes of eaſe are effects of eaſe, and productions of wits ſweetned by proſperity.</p>
               <p>Then they charge pleaſure with the vices of men, whereas it is not pleaſure but men that muſt be blamed: For pleaſure doth not corrupt men, but men corrupt pleaſure. It muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged good in it ſelfe. It is the ſeaſoning that God all-wiſe and all-good hath given to things profitable and actions neceſſary, that wee
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170100:65"/>ſhould ſeek them. Look upon a brave horſe with a judicious eye: After you have conſidered his great uſe, and praiſed the bounty of God for making an animal of ſo much ſervice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to man; praiſe God againe for making him ſo handſome and of ſuch a gallant mettle; And acknowledge that the gracious Creator re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as well mans delectation as utility. The delicious taſte of fruits, the fragrant ſmell and gay colours of flowers, the fair proſpect of groves, meadowes, calme and cleare waters, and all the delicate variety of Nature, ſpeake very expreſly that God, as an indulgent Father, hath taken great care to pleaſe and recreat us, and condemneth that ſad and ſowre wiſedome which deemeth to merit much by avoiding (at leaſt in ſhew) all that is pleaſing in Nature. Of that kinde, is this prayer which may be read in many Bookes of devote contemplation, <hi>Lord give me grace to be delighted in no earthly thing:</hi> Which is as much as ſaying to God, that he was much overſeen when he made his workes good and pleaſant, ſince it is ill done to delight in them, That devotion wants common ſence, if it be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and more if it be hypocritical.</p>
               <p>We muſt then place bodily pleaſure among the goods but among the leaſt, and thoſe in which beaſts have more ſhare then men. The more pleaſures are ſimple and natural, (as they are among beaſts) the more they are full and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170100:66"/>ſincere. But we by our wit make a toyle of a pleaſure, and drown nature in art.</p>
               <p>He that can ſet a right value upon Beauty, Health, and Strength, of which we ſpake lately, may eaſily do the ſame of the pleaſure which they are capable to give or to receive. If then theſe qualities be but weake tranſitory and of ſhort continuance, they cannot yeeld or feele a pleaſure, ſolid, conſtant, and permanent. Health, the beſt of the three, is rather a privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diſeaſe then a pleaſure, and it makes the body as ſenſible of paine as of delight, of which many that enjoy a perfect health are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived.</p>
               <p>It is a great abatement of the price of bodily pleaſure, that one muſt ſeldome uſe it to uſe it well, yea and to preſerve it, for the exceſſe of it is vicious, be the way never ſo lawfull; and the ſatiety of it breeds ſaſtidiouſneſſe and wearineſſe. Whereas true pleaſure conſiſting in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and love of God, one cannot ſinne, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, nor loſe the reliſh of it by fulneſſe; but the appetite is increaſed, and the faculty mended by enjoying.</p>
               <p>Pleaſures of the body, though in themſelves good and deſireable, are given by God for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, and to invite us to actions of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or utility: But ſpiritual pleaſure, which is to know and love God, is altogether for it ſelfe, and for nothing beyond it: for there the pleaſure
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170100:66"/>is ſo united with the duty, that the glory which we give to God, and that which we enjoy by knowing and loving him, are ſweetly confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together and become but one thing.</p>
               <p>This conſideration, that bodily pleaſures are appointed for a further end, helps much to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their price and their uſe. For the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the taſte is to invite the appetite to eate, eating is to live, living is to ſerve God; and betweene theſe two laſt, there are other ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, for many actions of life are for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall good, domeſticall good for the civill, the civill good for the religious. Bodily pleaſure ſtanding naturally on the loweſt round of this ladder, is removed out of its proper place, when it is placed above the ſuperiour ends; which is done, when the actions of life which are due to the domeſtical &amp; civill good, and before and after all to the religious, are imployed to make a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end of thoſe things that are ſubordinate to them as inferiour meanes. For we muſt deſire to eate for to live, not to live for the pleaſure of eating, &amp; ſo of other natural pleaſures, the deſire whereof becomes vicious, when thoſe things to which by nature they ought to ſerve, are ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them.</p>
               <p>Pleaſures are good ſervants but ill Maſters. They will recreate you when you make them your ſervants: But when you ſerve them they will tyrannize over you. A voluptuous nice man
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170100:67"/>is alwayes diſcontented and in ill humor. Where others find commodity he finds incommodity. He depriveth himſelfe of the benefit of ſimple and eaſy pleaſures. He looſeth pleaſure by too much ſeeking. By ſoothing up his ſenſes he diſeaſeth them, and paine penetrates ſooner and deeper into a body ſoftned with voluptuouſneſſe. But he that leſſe courteth pleaſure enjoyeth it more, for he is eaſily contented. To live at eaſe in the world we muſt harden our body, ſtrengthen our mind, and abridge our cupidity.</p>
               <p>In nothing the folly and perverſity of the world is ſo much ſeene as in this, that of the things which Gods indulgence hath given to man for his ſolace and recreation he makes the cauſes of his miſery, the baits of his ſinne, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his condemnation; for, from the abuſe of pleaſure proceeds the greateſt part of the evills that are in the world, both the evills which men ſuffer and thoſe which they commit; Yea, from thence all evils proceed, if wee remount to the firſt ſinne.</p>
               <p>Therefore a wiſe man will abſtaine from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull pleaſures, and taſte the lawfull with moderation, leſt that by exceſſe he make them unlawfull. Knowing that pleaſure which ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from duty ends in ſorrow; that it is no gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry to offend God; and that no delight can countervaile the loſſe of the ſerenity of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Vice it ſelfe will teach us vertue: For
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170100:67"/>when we ſee the ſlaves of voluptuouſnes, get in that ſervice a diſeaſed body, a ſad heart, a troubled conſcience, infamy, want, and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, we find it an ill bargaine to buy pleaſure at ſo deare a rate.</p>
               <p>This obſervation alſo will be of ſome helpe for the valuation of pleaſure. That the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that ſtick moſt to the matter are the moſt unworthy, as all the pleaſures of the taſte and feeling; and thoſe pleaſures that recede fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the matter are more worthy as the pleaſures of the ſight: Wherefore the pleaſure of hearing is yet more worthy, as having more affinity with the minde. And as they are more worthy they are alſo more innocent. But in all things exceſſe is vicious.</p>
               <p>As exceſſe in pleaſures is vicious, ſo is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For God hath made many handſome and good things to pleaſe us, in which nevertheleſſe we take no content, and many times reject them out of niceneſſe. How many perfect workes of God ſtrike their image into our eyes, and yet enter not into our thoughts? How many conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences are ſent to us by Gods good hand, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to fill our minds with comfort and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, if we had the grace to conſider them; and we think not of them though we make uſe of them. We are ſo inchanted with falſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that we loſe the taſte of the true. But a wiſe man is innocently inventive to ſolace him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170100:68"/>and finds every where matter of pleaſure. All things without ſmile upon him, becauſe his ſpirit is ſmiling within; and he lends to objects his owne ſerenity, whereby he makes them pleaſant.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of the Evils oppoſite to the forenamed Goods.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is to make the title ſhort, that I call them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, not to condemne without appeale &amp; infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matition all that is not in the liſt of the goods of fortune and goods of the Body. By looking upon theſe goods we may judge of their oppoſites: An eaſy worke, for having found nogreat excellency in theſe goods &amp; no ſolid content in the poſſeſſion of them, it followes that to be without them is no great miſery.</p>
               <p>They muſt be viewed impartially, for there is both good and evil every where, although to ſpeake Philoſophically and properly, the true evill and the true good lie within us. The ſilly vulgar cannot comprehend that a man can finde his happineſſe and unhappineſſe within himſelfe, and ſeeke their good abroad where it is not; toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſweating, and wearing out their life with labour in that queſt and making themſelves miſetable out of feare of miſery. Whereas moſt accidents without are neither Good nor evill in themſelves, and become good or evill to us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170100:68"/>to the diſpoſition of our minds. And of things within us, there are but two in themſelves evill, Sinne, and Paine.</p>
               <p>Stoicians will not acknowledge paine to be evill, becauſe it ſticks to the body onely, which, ſay they, is mans lodging not man himſelfe. But what-man feels all the incommodities of that lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſoul is tyed by perſonal Union with the ſenſes and really ſuffers what they ſuffer. So to maintaine, that paine is not evil when one feels it, commanding the outward countenance to unmoovedneſſe in the midſt of the ſharpe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſtone and the gout, laughing when one hath more minde to cry, is increaſing paine with the addition of conſtraint, and heaping folly upon miſery.</p>
               <p>But paine becomes a bleſſing to the wiſe and godly, which learne by it to weane their hearts from the love of the world and themſelves, and to ſeeke in God that comfort which they finde not in this world and this life: for <hi>all things helpe together for good unto them that love God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein the ſenſes may do good ſervice to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon &amp; piety, to find content in many things where others find the contrary. Some will declame gainſt the ſenſes as ill Judges of the goodneſſe and badneſſe of things. To whom we muſt ſay that the ſenſes are never Judges but informers, and that the ill information that our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding receiveth of the quality of the objects ought
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170100:69"/>not to be imputed to the ſenſes, for they plainly report what they perceive, but to the prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Imagination, which upon their ſimple infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation frameth falſe Ideas, ſet off with colours of her owne, which ſhe preſents to the Judgement, and makes him Judge amiſſe through misinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>If we will then get good ſervice from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the right informing of our judgment, we muſt obtaine of ourſelves theſe two points. The one not to receive their teſtimony but about their proper objects, which are the outward qualities wherewith the ſenſes are affected. The other not to preoccupate them with Imagination, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Paſſion. So when they are confined to their owne province and become impartial witneſſes, it will be eaſy to perſwade our reaſon rather to beleev our owne ſenſe, then the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another.</p>
               <p>Thus, when we deſire to know whether we be unhappy becauſe we are deprived of riches, kept back from honours, without reputation, or ill reputed in the world, we muſt not referre our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about that to the Opinion and talk of the world, but to our owne ſenſe. Let us ſincerely examine our ſenſes, what harme wee receive by it. Are we more hungry or cold by theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes? Doth the Sunne ſhine leſſe bright upon us? Is our bed harder? Is our meat leſſe feeding? If our ſenſes thus examined, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170100:69"/>to complaine of, and yet we complaine that wee are come ſhort of ſome hopes, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtep before us, that the world regards us not, or ſpeakes ill of us; Let us ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, upon the teſtimony of our ſenſes, that we are well if we can beleeve it, and that it is not out of Senſe but Opinion that we are afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>This is the difference betweene fooles and wiſe men, Fools conſult Opinion and Cuſtome: Wiſemen conſult reaſon, piety, and nature. Fooles regard what others think: Wiſemen conſider what themſelves finde and feele. Fooles gape after things abſent: Wiſemen poſſeſſe the preſent and themſelves. O how many men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that have no hurt, but in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! which is indeed a great hurt, and incurable many times. When you ſee a man rich and healthful, tearing his heart for ſome inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſſe, or for the raſh words of an ill tongue; deſire him to aske his ſenſes, where the paine is. And if he feele no paine by it, why doth he put himſelfe to paine? Why is he ill, when he may be well? He is well, if he can but heale his imagination. Is it not a diſgrace to a reaſonable creature, that whereas reaſon ought to rectify the ſences, the ſenſes ſhould need to rectify rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon! and that men who love themſelves ſo much muſt be exhorted to do no harme to themſelves when they feele no harme? A rational godly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170100:70"/>man will examine what he feeles, and will do no harme to himſelfe when God doth him good. And when his ſenſes have reaſon to complaine, he will quietly hearken to them, and rather beleeve their report about the meaſure of the evill then the cryes of the by-ſtanders that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate him. He will not be eaſily perſwaded that he is ſicker then he is indeed, and will not increaſe his paine with his imagination. And whereas others make themſelves ſick out of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination when they are well; he will uſe his imagination, to make himſelfe well when he is ill.</p>
               <p>Not that I would adviſe a man to blind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for feare of ſeeing, and dull his ſenſe for feare of feeling evills: For the better we know the nature of things, the better we know how to deale with them, that we may avoid or beare the evill that is in them. But becauſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination hath a real force to increaſe or diminiſh many evils, it is the part of a wiſeman alwayes to imploy the ſtrength of his imagination to his advantage, never to his hurt.</p>
               <p>The evills where the indulgence of Opinion muſt be uſed to make them lighter are the evills of the body and fortune; But as for the evils of the mind which are the vices of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the will, there the flattery of Opinion is moſt dangerous; for the principal ſickneſſe of the mind is, that one thinkes not himſelfe to be ſick.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:170100:70"/>
               <p>I have adviſed reaſon to take counſel of the ſenſes when the imagination aggravateth the evil, or makes it, and yet the ſenſes are free of paine: But when the ſenſes are offended in earneſt, then they muſt take counſel of reaſon, and more yet of piety, to finde ſome eaſe.</p>
               <p>Let us meditate upon the nature of thoſe evils of fortune and body, ſo much feared in the world. He that gives a right Judgement of the evill, hath halfe found the remedy.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of Poverty.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere be many degrees of civill poverty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of conditions and buſineſſes. To a Soveraigne prince, it is Poverty to have leſſe then a hundred thouſand pounds a yeare; but to a husbandman it is riches to have twenty pounds a yeare rent free. In all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thoſe are truly poore that have not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to maintaine that courſe of life which they have ſet up, and all men that cannot ſatiate their cupidity. Thus very few rich men will be found in the world, ſince there are but few that aſpire not to greater things then they can compaſſe, and deſire no more then they have. All that finde want are poore, whether their want be of things neceſſary or ſuperfluous, and among many degrees of poore men, there is but one Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:170100:71"/>
               <p>Yet thoſe are the pooreſt that finde want of ſuperfluous things, becauſe that kinde of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is made worſe by the increaſe of riches. To ſuch men, God is juſt and merciful together, when he healeth that wanton-need, with a pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing need of things neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Need is the thing that is generally moſt feared of all men: Certainly it is moſt incommodious, even to the wiſeſt. Wherefore the Wiſeman in the 30. of <hi>Proverbs</hi> beſought God that he would not ſend it him. It is an ordinary theme for elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and flouriſhes of wit to maintaine that Need is not evill; and they that deſcant more upon it are they that leſſe feele it; as <hi>Seneca,</hi> a man of prodigious wealth, who many times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends extream poverty, or the condition that is not farre from it. They ſay indeed that it is to the wiſe onely, that need is not evill; but becauſe that muſt be proved by the experience of a true and perfect wiſeman, we would have the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſuch a man: but ſuch a man we finde not, neither do all the ſects of Philoſophers that profeſt poverty, afford ſuch an example. For we will not ſtand to the arbitrement of that ſawcy begger <hi>Diogenes,</hi> a vaine ſordid and affected man in all his words and actions, who tooke a naſty pride in an impudent mendicity. If poverty did not make him evill he made poverty evill, turning it into a profeſſion; and inſtead of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it an exerciſe of vertue, uſing it as a pretence of idleneſſe and licentiouſneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:170100:71"/>
               <p>To the ordinary ſort of minds, Need is a gulfe of miſery. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.20. <hi>The poore is hated even of his own neighbour.</hi> Every one hides himſelfe from him. Need makes men aſhamed, and ſhame increaſeth their need. Some alſo by Need are made ſhameleſſe, and in the end bold theeves. <hi>Qui paupertatem timet, timendus eſt.</hi> Need is an ill counſellor: It makes men murmure againſt God and finde fault with the diſtribution of his goods. It beates down the courage, ſtupefyeth or ſowreth the wit, and clips the wings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. It is hard for one to have high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, when he wants bread.</p>
               <p>Yet, to ſpeake properly, Want doth not all that evill, but the evill diſpoſition of men, that have not weaned their heart from the world, nor ſought their only treaſure in heaven, &amp; have not choſen God for their portion: No wonder that their ſpirit is beaten down as well as their fortune, when the worldly ground, which they had built upon, ſinkes under their feet.</p>
               <p>But he that deſpiſeth the world and the life of the world, deſpiſeth alſo Want ſo much feared by others. For, take things at the worſt, (a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual rule of wiſedome about caſual future things) the worſt that can come to him that is without bread, is to be without life, which a thouſand other accidents may take from us. Life is a <hi>depoſitum</hi> which God hath committed to our keeping: No lawful diligence and induſtry muſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170100:72"/>be omitted that we may preſerve it and give a good account of it to God; And himſelfe having truſted us with it, aſſiſts us to keepe it. Very ſeldome it is heard, that any perſons dye for lack of bread. But <hi>precious in the ſight of God is any death of his Saints, Pſal.</hi> 116.15. Neither is there any more curſe in dying of hunger, then of a ſurfet.</p>
               <p>Of all kinds of death, but the ſuddaine, I hold death for want of food to be the eaſieſt. It is no more but letting the lamp quietly to go out. <hi>Atticus</hi> after a long faſt to overcome an acute ſickneſſe, having loſt the appetite of meat, loſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the appetite of life, and refuſing to take any more meat, dyed without paine. And ſo <hi>Tullius Marcellinus,</hi> after an abſtinence of three dayes <hi>Molliſſime exceſſit et vitae elapſus eſt,</hi> he departed moſt quietly and eſcaped from life, ſaith <hi>Seneca.</hi> He ſpake better then he meant, ſaying that <hi>he eſcaped;</hi> for ſuch a volutary death was <hi>an eſcape</hi> from the ſtation, where God hath placed him. He went from life without commiſſion, for God had given him wherewith to keep it: But he to whom God giveth no more wherewith to keep himſelfe alive muſt acknowledge that his commiſſion is out, &amp; depart cheerefully. For to prevent death by ſordid and unlawfull wayes is more then God calls him unto, and more then life is worth. To ſay, neceſſity compels me to theſe wayes, and otherwiſe I cannot live, is an ignorant or wilfull miſtake of Neceſſity; The wayes cannot
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170100:72"/>be neceſſary, when the end is not ſo: And before a man conclude that ſuch wayes are neceſſary becauſe without them he cannot live, he ſhould conſider whether it be neceſſary for him to live. It is neceſſary for us to be righteous and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; not, to live. Who ſo conceiveth no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in life, and no evill in death (which to Gods children is the end of all evills, and the beginning of all happineſſe) will ſoon rid his heart of that cowardly fear of dying for want, and reject the temptations to lead an ill life that he may keep life.</p>
               <p>The feare of Want is for want of obeying Chriſts command, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.34. <hi>not to take thought for the morrow;</hi> and for want of obſerving the courſe of his providence which provideth for his creatures that cannot provide for themſelves: Beaſts ſleep quietly not knowing and not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where they ſhall get meat the next day. You will ſay, it is becauſe they have no reaſon and no foreſight; and were it not better to have no reaſon, then to make no uſe of it but for our vexation! Were it not better to be incapable of thinking on God as beaſts are, then to think on him onely to miſtruſt and murmure againſt his providence?</p>
               <p>A poore man to whom God giveth health &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to get his living is poſſeſt of a great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and a ſtock yeelding him a daily rent. His condition is incomparably more happy then that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170100:73"/>of the noble and wealthy. The labour that gets him bread, gets him alſo an appetite to eate it, and ſleep to refreſh him when he is weary, and health to continne his labour; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.12. <hi>The ſleep of a labouring man is ſweet, whether he eate little or much, but the abundance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep:</hi> His many children give him leſſe care, then fewer children to the rich, and leſſe paine alſo to provide for them.

Children are the riches of poore people, and the impoveriſhing of the rich. Then to give them portions; the Father that hath no land is not troubled to engage the Lordſhips of the eldeſt Sonne for the marriages of his Daughters, nor to charge the land with annuityes for the younger Brothers. Each of them hath the whole ſucceſſion, which is their Fathers labour. No doubt, but that is the moſt tranquil condition of all.</p>
               <p>The examples are many, of thoſe that lived merrily and ſung at their worke as long as they were poore; but an inheritance unlooked for, being fallen into their lap, they have given over ſinging, and turned ſad and full of thoughts. <hi>Anacreon</hi> came once to that trouble, but he rid
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170100:73"/>himſelfe of it. He was a Poet, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poore. <hi>Polycrates</hi> the rich Tyrant of <hi>Samos</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed two or three thouſand Crownes upon him. But <hi>Anacreon</hi> after he had kept them three dayes reſtored them to his benefactor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaid he, that-money would not let him ſleep. Which action was not the production of a Philoſophical minde, for by his Poemes now extant it appeareth that wine and women were the higheſt ſpheres of his contemplation; but the true cauſe was, that he found riches heavier to beare then poverty.</p>
               <p>I was ſaying that Poverty beates down the courage and ſtupefyeth the wit; but it is onely with them that had no great courage and no great wit before, and they would have bin more beaten down and ſtupefyed by riches, but in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way: for riches ſwell indeed the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with pride, but they beat it down at the ſame time with feare, and make it ſoft with voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; they ſlacken diligence, &amp; blunt the edge of induſtry, but poverty whets it, &amp; awakens and ſharpens the wit, if there be any. Riches in a competent meaſure are more accommodate to the operations of the ſpeculative underſtanding; for high and curious contemplations require a minde free of cares, and reſted with plenty. A man that wanteth bread hath no thoughts of finding longitudes and the pole of the load-ſtone, or the exquiſiteneſs of eloquence: <hi>Magnae mentis
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170100:74"/>opus, nec de lodîce parandâ Attonitae.</hi> Poverty is fitter for the operations of the practical underſtanding, for neceſſity is the mother of arts. <hi>Magiſter artis ingenîque largitor venter:</hi> We owe moſt part of mechanique inventions to men put to their ſhifts.</p>
               <p>The beſt thing that is in Poverty is, that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a ſound and godly mind, it helps to weane it from the world, and raiſe it up to God, which is the great worke of a Chriſtian, to which riches are a great hindrance. He that hath but little in the world, finds in his poverty a great motive to lay up treaſure it heaven, to which he is invited by the example of the Lord Jeſus, who made himſelfe poore to make us rich in God. To the poore was the Goſpel firſt preacht, and when it was preach to the rich and poore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the poore were the firſt that embraced it, becauſe they were leſſe tyed unto the world, and at more liberty to go to God.</p>
               <p>It is moſt obſervable that all perſons admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to ſalvation are received in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of poore, and the rich muſt make themſelves poore before God through humility and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that they may be capable of that high bleſſing whereby Chriſt began his ſermon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> To that Poverty in ſpirit the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in worldly goods is a great help. A wiſe and godly man, that knoweth how to get advantage
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170100:74"/>by all things will prudently manage all the helps to heaven which poverty affords, when he ſhall be brought to that condition. He will become more ſerene in his devotions, more reſolute in his dangers, more undaunted to maintaine the truth, lighter to flee from one Citty to another in time of perſecution, and better diſpoſed at all times to welcom death, caſting no back-look upon the world where he hath nothing to loſe. If he had once riches, and hath loſt them, he will acknowledge that they were none of his, ſince they could not ſtay with him; for the true goods of a man are inſeperable from him, as being within him. Theſe goods are, a right reaſon, integrity of conſcience, the love of God, faith in his promiſes, and an appetite led by reaſon and piety. With that patrimony he may ſay with more reaſon then <hi>Bias,</hi> in what condition ſoever he be, <hi>I carry all my goods along with me.</hi> The goods of fortune deſerve not the name of goods.</p>
               <p>To him that deſireth nothing but what is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Nature, poverty doth no harme; and to him that deſireth more, poverty doth good; for it brings him to ſobriety. To have little and to be contented with it, is a great wealth.</p>
               <p>Poverty and riches having their commodities and incommodities, the moſt deſireable tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eſtate is the midlemoſt, which is neither, and holds of both. That ſtate the wiſe man requeſted at Gods hands, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Give me neither po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty

               </head>
               <p>IT is, in the Judgement of many, worſe yet then poverty; and it is for its ſake that they feare poverty. It is of ſeveral degrees and is more or leſſe grievous according to the diverſity of perſons and deſignes. To them that aſpire to honours, but are kept back, and think they loſe all they cannot get, it is unſufferable; and more yet to them that had honours and were juſtled out of them; for men will get up to honour with a good will, but none deſcends from it unleſſe he be hurled downe; which hath given occaſion to the inſtitution of yearely Magiſtrates. Others are bred in a low condition and aſpire not much higher, yet they groane under the yoake which their condition ingageth them unto. Thus all are diſcontented, and none are ſo high but think themſelves too low.</p>
               <p>The low condition indeed is ſlaviſh, eſpecially in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Poland;</hi> and he that can handſomely
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170100:75"/>get out of the bottom where the land-flood of the publique ſtormes ſtayeth, and take himſelfe out of the number of the beaſts of carriage, ſhall do prudently to ſeek his liberty. St. <hi>Pauls</hi> advice is judicious <hi>Art thou called being a ſervant? care not for it: but if thou mayeſt be made free, uſe it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21. If it be impoſſible for a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to get that liberty, let him conſider that as the low condition is more onerous, ſo it is leſſe dangerous; In <hi>France</hi> eſpecially, where although the armies conſiſt of high and low, yet the maine ſhock of battles falles upon the Gentry, and the beſt of the Nobility. The hazardous attempts fall to their ſhare. All may follow warre, but the Gentry hold it their proper trade. The <hi>French</hi> Gentleman is borne in a manner with his ſword by his ſide. Who ſo will obſerve how in noble houſes two thirds of their branches are lopt off by warre, ſhall finde that the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie pay deare for their immunities.</p>
               <p>To beare with the low condition, one ſhould obſerve well the inconveniences of the high. The higher a man ſtands, the fairer mark doth he give to envy, ſecret undermining, and open hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Great places are like ſtilts upon which a man hath but a tottering ſtanding, eſpecially in a croud, where all juſtle againſt him to make him fall. A Crowne loads a Kings head and covers it not, but lets in on all ſides the arrowes that are ſhot againſt it. There is no need of deep Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170100:76"/>to be free from the deſire of it, and of all places of great reſpect and great buſines. One needs but know them, and love himſelfe. All great dignities are great miſeries. It muſt needs be that there is ſome fatality for the ſubſiſtence of the general, that ſets-on men to thruſt blindly forward for high dignities; Otherwiſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all voluptuous &amp; lovers of themſelvs, would not take ſo much labour as to climb up with hands and feet unto their misfortune. A wiſe man will love his own reſt better then to crowd for dignities; chooſing rather to ſit upon lower ſteps, and to owe his tranquillity to his obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He will eſteeme no honour or great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worth loſing the liberty of meditation, and the holy and heavenly converſation with God: for who would come from heaven to be toyling in the earth? As valleys have leſſe wind and more heat of the Sunne then mountaines, ſo the low condition hath leſſe agitation then the high, and the rayes of the Snune of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will commonly ſhine upon it more graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and powerfully,</p>
               <p>Nobility of extraction being nothing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſame is true alſo of meane blood; both conſiſt in Opinion, and yet not in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the perſons concerned, but of others, which to any wiſeman muſt be of very ſmal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. In any condition one may have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural nobility, conſiſting in a meeke and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170100:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>diſpoſition, apt to the knowledge of great things, and ſo well ſeaſoned with vertue. By that deſcription how many ignoble perſons will be found among the Noble by extraction, and how many noble among perſons of meane deſcent? God deliver us from Gentlemen of the ſavage kinde that make nobility to conſiſt in barbarouſneſſe, idleneſſe, and contempt of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane lawes; and from ignobleup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarts, who to approve themſelves Gentlemen ſtrive to outdoe them that are ſo, in pride and licentiouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>But there is a nobility infinitely above the beſt natural nobility. (I bring not the Cvil within this compariſon, it is nothing but fortune and Opinion) That high tranſcendent nobility is but to be the child of God by Jeſus Chriſt, and heire of his Kingdome. The titles of that nobility are from all eternity, and will be to all eternity; and by it a man riſeth ſo high as to <hi>become parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. ſaith St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Who ſo hath the patents of that nobility, and makes himſelfe ſure of them by a lively faith working by love, is neither puft up nor beaten downe with his temporal condition. He will look with contempt upon the vulgar contentions about the firſt place, much like the emulation of horſes ſtriving who ſhould go the formeſt of a company. And truly it is a quality of good hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not of good men. A man honoured with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170100:77"/>ſpiritual nobility if he have temporal nobility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, muſt keep his degree, but eſteeme it too low to glory in it. And if he have not that worldly advantage, he will be content with the heavenly, knowing that being one of Gods children he cannot be further ennobled.</p>
               <p>As we that live upon Earth find it very great, and ſee the Sunne very little although it be a hundred and threeſcore times greater then the Earth; Likewiſe to men altogether earthy, the honours of the earth ſeeme very great, and the heavenly nobility but a ſmall thing: But if from the Orbe of the Sun the Earth may be ſeene (as it is very likely) no doubt but it appeares a very ſmall thing, as leſſer then moſt of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Starres. Worldly honours appeare leſſer yet, to him that hath the true ſence of his heavenly nobility, and lookes upon Earth as it were from Heaven. The time draweth nigh that will make Kings and Beggers alike in the duſt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>REal diſhonour is within, and conſiſteth in viciouſneſſe and indignity of the perſon; for by it a man is ſeparate from God the ſcource of honour, out of whom there is nothing but diſhonour and miſery. But the diſhonour which we are here to conſider is out of the perſon, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170100:77"/>conſiſteth in the Opinion of others. Theſe two ſorts of diſhonour do not meet alwayes, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are vicious and infamous before God are honoured of men, even becauſe they are vicious; and others that are good &amp; honoured with Gods love, are blamed and diſhonored of men, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are good; So erroneous and fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call is the judgement of the multitude.</p>
               <p>We have already found that therenowne and praiſe that men give is but winde; that is enough to judge that the blame and infamy which they give, is of the ſame ſubſtance. It is ſuch an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary evill, that it is almoſt impoſſible to find out in what ſubject it ſubſiſteth. It is not in him that is blamed, for what is that to him that is in the grave, or to him that is alive and knowes it not, or careth not for it? It is not alſo in him that blameth; for it proceeds indeed from him but ſubſiſteth not in him: elſe he that blameth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a murther ſhould be a murtherer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. If then the blame ſubſiſt neither in the blamed, nor in the blamer, where ſhall wee finde its ſubſiſtence betweene both? It may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it ſubſiſteth in the blamed perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſticks ſo faſt many times to him, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates ſo deep, that it kills him with ſorrow. Yea but to ſpeak properly and truly, it is not the blame that doth the harme, but the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blamed, prevented with an erronious Opinion, which makes a man fanſy an evil where
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170100:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>there is none, and do to himſelfe that harme which none could have done him but himſelfe: And is not that voluntary paine, which is not felt unleſſe a man have a minde to feele it? God give me never greater evills then thoſe that cannot hurt me unleſſe I will be hurt, and have need to begge my conſent and my hand to give me the blow.</p>
               <p>A wiſe man will deſpiſe, not onely that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary evil, but even the remedy. For what need of a plaiſter where there is no ſore? When his friends come to him to comfort him becauſe that ſome have ſpoken ill of him, he will deſire then to apply the remedy where the diſeaſe is, even to the raſhnes of the judgement of thoſe weake perſons, and to the intemperance of their tongue. And will think that their applying a balſome of conſolations to his heart, for a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his neighbours braines, no leſſe ſtrange and extravagant, then if they would warme his bed becauſe his horſe hath a cold.</p>
               <p>This is indeed the right reaſoning when the thing is conſidered in its proper and bare nature, but becauſe the world being prepoſſeſt with a wrong opinion of a worthy man may be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do him harme, or hindred to do him good, or deprived of the good he might do to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique; that worthy man muſt not altogether neglect to rectifye the miſconceits taken againſt him, which he may with leſſe difficulty atchieve
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170100:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>by a ſerene and conſtant courſe of integrity then by finding and proving, confuting, and keeping a great buſtle to bring contrary witneſſes face to face.

               <p>OUr judgement being ſatisfyed that the good of the body, beauty, ſtrength health and pleaſure are none of the great goods, we ought alſo to bee perſwaded that their contraries are none of the great evills.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170100:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>for a few daies as ought not to diſquiet us mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of any importance.</p>
               <p>To beginne at Unhandſomneſſe; if a woman be unhandſome (for that ſexe is eſpecially ſenſible of that diſgrace) let her ſtay but a while; age will bring all the beauties to her row, within few yeares, and death after; That laſt day draweth neere, which will make faire and foule alike, ſtrong and weake, ſick and ſound; them that are tormented with dolour, and them that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelves with voluptuouſneſſe and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity. Whoſoever is much grieved with thoſe incommodities never apprehended aright the frailty of the oppoſite commodities. We muſt not be vexed for the want of things, which by their nature decay and periſh very houre.</p>
               <p>There are few incommodities but have a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of commodities, which a wiſe lover of his owne tranquillity will pick and convert to his advantage. The unhandſome woman ſhall not be admired, but in recompence ſhe ſhall not be tempted nor importuned as a prey by luſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence. She hath with her a perpetual exhorter to humility, piety, and all vertue, and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the want of beauty with goodneſſe. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is unhandſomneſſe reproached to women, but to them that aggravate with malice &amp; envy their diſgraces of nature. Beauty cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but goodneſſe may. Yet among them that want beauty, ſome are ſo wiſe and ſo good that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170100:79"/>they become handſome. They are commonly more happy in marriage then great beauties; for they give leſſe jealouſy to their husbands, and ſtudy more to content them.</p>
               <p>Perſons of weak conſtitution are leſſe obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to acute ſickneſſes, which many times will kil ſtrong bodyes in three or foure dayes. They are leſſe tainted with that ſtupid pride, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attends great ſtrength of body. Finding themſelves inferiour to others in excerciſes of ſtrength, they apply themſelves to exerciſes of wit, to which commonly they are more apt. As weezels have more mettle and nimbleneſſe then Oxen; there is often more induſtry and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wit in little weak men, then in men of of large and brawny limbs; for the predominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of blood and phlegme which makes the body large, is the duller temper for wit; whereas cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and melancholy which by their contractive quality limit the ſtretching of growth to a leſſer extent, ſerve alſo, the one to ſharpen the wit, the other to give ſolidity to the judgement. Weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe reads to a man a continual Lecture of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and compliance; for being not able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his deſignes with a high hand, dexterity onely will ſerve his turne.</p>
               <p>Alſo that want of ſtrength teacheth him to make God his ſtrength, ſticking faſt to him by faith and a good conſcience. That way the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt become too ſtrong for all the world. <hi>When I

               <p>Of this, Gods children have a bleſſed experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſickneſſe, whereby God makes their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy weake to make their faith ſtrong, and their ſoules, by the dolours and lingring decay of their bodies, ſuſceptible of many ſalutary leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for which health and eaſe have no eares.</p>
               <p>Sickneſſe and paine are evill in their nature, but they are good by accident, when God is pleaſed to turne evills into remedies, to bring a man to repentance and make him looke up to the hand that ſtriketh. They are puniſhments to ſin and wayes to death, but to the faithful ſoul they become inſtruments of grace and conveighances to glory. Many of them that beleeved in the Lord Jeſus while he converſed among men were brought to it by bodily ſickneſſes, And he when he healed a ſick perſon, often would ſay, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To give an impartial judgement of their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and meaſure, one muſt rather beleeve what he feeles then the cryes and compaſſion of them that love him, and have intereſt in his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They ſay, that a man is very ſick when he feeles not his ſickneſſe. Yet he hath ſo much good time, till he feele it, If the paine be ſharp, it is ſhort; If it be little it is tolerable; If the evill be curable, be patient, good Cure will heale it, If the evill be incurable, be patient death will
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170100:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>heale it. No evill is ſuperlative when one is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to come out of it; By life or by death there muſt be an end of thy ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>All the remedies that Pagan Philoſophy gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in extremities, come to this, that patience is a remedy to evills that have none. But here Chriſtian Philoſophy openeth the treaſure of divine comforts, which to make the faithfull man patient in tribulation, make him joyfull in hope, &amp; ſhew him the crown ready for him at the end of the combat. In the combat he is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by faith; and the comforter whom Chriſt promiſt to his diſciples, powerfully aſſiſteth him in his laſt agony; Or if his triall be prolonged, he tels him, as <hi>Paul</hi> buffeted by a meſſenger of Satan 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe.</hi>
               </p>

The world is the natural and general countrey of al men: To be exiled is but to be ſent from one Province of our Countrey to another. That other Province, where one is exiled is the Countrey of them that are borne there, and of them alſo that live there exiled, if there they get accomodation. That particular Province which a nation calls their Countrey, is a place of exile to them that are borne in it, if they doe not know it; as to <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> exiled from the place where he was bred, to the place where he was borne. Children brought from nurſe to the mothers houſe wil cry, taking it for a place of exile. It is a childiſh weakneſſe in a man to thinke him-ſelfe loſt when he is in a place where he never was before. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where wee have the ſame nature, the ſame heaven, men of the ſame kind. Reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170100:81"/>ſhould be aſhamed to be ſurmounted by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, in that eaſineſſe to ſhift Countreies. Swallowes hatch about our houſes, are baniſht from our Climat by the approach of winter, and they make no difficulty to goe ſeeke another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond al the lands and Seas of <hi>Europe:</hi> but men wil cry when they are driven from their chimney corner, having the choice of al places of the world which is ſo large. Yet that advantage we have over birds and beaſts, that al Countries are not alike to them, but al Countries are alike unto vertue, and to us if we have it; for that treaſure no enemy can hinder us to carry along with us.</p>
               <p>We may indeed be exiled into an ill Countrey, but that Countrey is never the worſe for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Countrey. All lands are in equal diſtance from heaven, the Countrey of gods children. God is as ſoon found in the land of our exile, as in that of our birth and ſooner too; for God is neer thoſe that are deſtitute, and <hi>preſerveth the ſtranger, Pſal.</hi> 146.9. Are you baniſht by a Tyrant? Thinke how many perſons are exiled from their countrey and deareſt relations by their covetouſneſſe, which is the worſt tyranny, ranging the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſeas of a new world for many years; ſome to fetch cucineel and pearles from burning cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats, others to get ſables and hermines from the ſnows under the <hi>Pole.</hi> Some are baniſht by others, ſome bythem-ſelves. Nothing is ſtrange to a man when his wil goeth along with it; we need
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170100:82"/>but to encline our wil where neceſſity calls us. Impatience in exile is want of a right apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the condition of gods children in the world. Heaven is their countrey. Life is their Pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. They are ſtrangers even in the place of their birth, yea in their very bodys: Whileſt we are at home in the body, we are ſtrangers from the Lord, ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. Being then ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in al places of the world, one place muſt not ſeeme to us more ſtrange then another. Wee are never out of our way, as long as we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God.</p>

               <p>PRiſon is the grave of the living. There men are buried before their death: Liberty is the priviledge of nature, without which life is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual death. And it were better to have noe life then not to enjoy it. All beaſts enjoy liberty, ſome few excepted that have loſt it by being too much acquainted with us.</p>
               <p>But as there is need of iron cages to keepe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is need in the world of priſons and captivity to keepe in men that wil not be ruled by reaſon &amp; equity. And though many be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned wrongfully, if they have the grace to look up to God, the diſpoſer of their condition, they will acknowledge, that God is wiſe to uſe them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170100:82"/>ſo, and that licentious humour hath need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
               <p>Or if they need it not they have leſſe need to afflict themſelves: A well compoſed ſpirit is free in the cloſeſt Priſon; bonds and fetters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſtraine his liberty. The worſt fetters are covetouſneſſe, ambition, luſt, appetite of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, wherewith many that ſeeme free are kept in bondage. Who ſo can ſhake them off is at liberty, though he were in a dungeon. Such was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> freedom in a chaine. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. <hi>I ſuffer trouble</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>as an evill doer, even unto bonds, but the word of God is not bound.</hi> The grace of God alſo cannot be bound, and many times God makes uſe of the bonds of the body to ſet the ſoule free. A man is very hard tyed to the world, if he cannot be untied from it by a long impriſonment.</p>
               <p>Priſon will bee leſſe tedious to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth that it is his natural condition. That he was nine moneths Priſoner in his Mothers wombe. That after his death he ſhall be made cloſe Priſoner under ground; And that as long as he liveth he is loaden like a ſnaile with his owne Priſon, which he carrieth about ſlowly, and with great incommodity; a clog put by our wiſe Maſter to the ſwiftneſſe and quick turnes of our ſpirit which is alwayes in action. Think how faſt our thoughts go, which in a moment travell from one end of the world to the other, and how
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170100:83"/>high our deſignes will riſe, whoſe wings we are conſtrained to clip and abruptly to pull down our ſoaring minde, to look to the neceſſities of our craving body, and then acknowledge that our body is a very Priſon, confining the ſpirit, which is the Man. The impriſonment of that body is no great addition to its captivity. It is but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one boxe within another.</p>
               <p>And if we looke about us, how much captivity do me meet with in ſociety! Is not ceremony a ſlavery which is multiplyed and diverſifyed at every meeting? Are not honours golden fetters, and buſineſſes Iron fetters? Do not publique factions enſlave particular intereſſes, and ſpread nets for the conſcience? Many times that capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is avoided by that of the Counter and the Fleet. To many their priſon hath been a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a ſtrong hold againſt the dangers of a turbulent and deſtructive time.</p>
               <p>No dungeon is ſo cloſe as to keep the faithfull ſoul from riſing to God. They that are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the ſight of their friends, may converſe with God at any time, which is a great liberty: And the Lord Jeſus who recommends that worke of mercy to viſit the priſoners, himſelfe doth care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully practiſe it, comforting by his Spirit his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to whom the aſſiſtance of men is denyed, and ſhewing them heaven open when they are lockt and bolted. In effect it is the body, not man, that is impriſoned. The Jalour may keepe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170100:83"/>out a priſoners friends from him, but he cannot ſhut out comfort and tranquillity from his ſoul.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Husband, Wife, Children, Kindred, Friends: Their price, their Loſſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT may ſeeme that theſe ſhould have bin put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the goods of fortune. To which I might anſwer ſomewhat Stoically, that it is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether certaine whether they muſt be put among the goods or among the evills, for they may be either, as it falls out. But I rank them with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but among exteriour things, of which we muſt labour to get the right Opinion.</p>
               <p>To that end we muſt alwayes conſider them two wayes, as they are good or bad, and as they are neare to us in blood, or bonds of duty. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt the ſecond relation hinder the firſt, ſo foreſtalling the mind with the relations of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or Wife, Sonne or Brother, that one be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to make a right Judgement of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and capacity, and ſet a juſt price on them.</p>
               <p>The onely relation of Parents muſt ſpread a vaile of reverence betweene our eyes and their imperfections, that we may ſee nothing but good in them. There it is wiſedome to be ſomewhat deceived: Though it be not my theame to ſpeak of the duties to be rendred to our ſeveral relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170100:84"/>yet becauſe I ſeeke the contentment of mind, I cannot chuſe but ſay that of all civill and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties none is ſo contenting to him that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, as the duty payd to Parents. Herein <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mimondas</hi> Judged his victories moſt fortunate unto him that he had obtained them in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life time who did much rejoyce at them.</p>
               <p>To other relations we muſt alſo pay their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per duty. Of which wee muſt remember this general rule; That it is impoſſible to get content by them unleſſe we do our duty towards them. For that content muſt not be expected from them but from ourſelves. The content that one takes with a deare Wife, a good Brother, and a well choſen Friend, is more that which he giveth then that which he receiveth. It lyeth in the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his conſcience that he hath rendred to them the true offices of love.</p>
               <p>Without prejudice to thoſe duties, we may and ought impartially to conſider their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and abilities, and what may be expected of them. In thoſe relations which come by choyce, as of a Husband Wife and friend, the judgement muſt precede the affection, to finde what is fit for us before we fixe upon it: But in relations of Kindred made by nature without us, the affection muſt go before and the judgement muſt follow; that we may know them ſo well, that though we love them, we truſt them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to their honeſty and capacity, and no more.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:170100:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>In this point the vulgar ſort making many groſſe miſtaks. For it is an ordinary but an evill expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>I would truſt him as mine owne Brother.</hi> Yet moſt knaves have Brothers, who ſhould do very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſely to truſt them. The ſtyle of Merchants ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their ware is more ingemous, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to a Chapman to <hi>uſe him as if he were their Brother,</hi> for they would not ſcruple to cozen their Brother. And truly hence the word of <hi>cozening</hi> had its Origine, becauſe it is uſual to make uſe of the bond of Kindred to be truſted enough to deceive enough.</p>
               <p>For counſel and converſation we much chooſe the wiſeſt and worthieſt rather then the neareſt in blood: But when there is occaſion to give, or need to ſeeke help; we muſt runne to the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in blood rather then to the worthyeſt, if they be but honeſt. So much we muſt deferre to the choyce of Nature, that if there be any vertue in them, though but ſmall, we be neerer to them in affection then blood. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith that <hi>a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is borne for adverſity, Prov.</hi> 17.17. becauſe other friendſhips by differences, intervening of parties, intereſſes, and Opinions, are ſubject to coole and untie, but among Brethren thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are overcome by the ſtrength of nature; and in adverſity either good nature or feare of blame makes Brothers give real help to Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Wife and Children are the ſtrongeſt trials of a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170100:85"/>magnanimous ſpirit, for they make a mans heart tender, and in the pinches of adverſity make him deſcend to ungenerous ſhifts. He that hath none ſhal have leſſe delight &amp; leſſe ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Yet muſt we acknowledge that a mariage wel ſorted betweene two perſons of merit is of all worldly felicities the greateſt.</p>
               <p>Of children expect noe good but the ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have done them good, and to ſee them doe wel for them-ſelves. For in this relation the nature of beneficence is to deſcend, ſeldom to remount.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more pretious among humane things, then a vertuous loving freind, kinne or no kinne. And if he be one ſtory above us in nobility and vertue, he is better then lower. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality indeed is requiſit in friendſhip, but friend ſhip it ſelfe worketh that equality where it is not; And there is need of it, for it is impoſſible to find two friends in the world altogether equal in al reſpects.</p>
               <p>The price of friendſhip is according to the price of the perſon, whom therefore we muſt ſtudy to know wel, that we may love no perſon above or under his right value. A reaſonable benevolence of a man of great merit is more obliging then the ardent affection of an Idiot; From the former you may receive inſtruction honour and content; From the ſecond importunity, and the diſgrace to be paired with a man of no worth: Such a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170100:85"/>friendſhip will end in a breach, and ſo in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Whether friendſhips be knit by nature or by choyce, that we may not expect of them a content beyond their nature, we muſt remember that our freinds are men, whoſe love may, and whoſe life muſt faile. The uſe of them we may have, not the poſſeſſion. The beſt and moſt powerfull freinds are weake reeds, which we muſt not leane upon with all our weight, leſt they breake in our hand, and we take a ſore fall. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Curſed is the man that truſteth in man and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fleſh his arme Jer.</hi> 17.5. As this is a ſentence given by God againſt them that put their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in man, it is alſo a natural conſequence of the nature of the fault: For puting our confidence in man is going out of our ſelues: It is going out of God: It is making men Gods, for unto God only is that homage due of an abſolute and total confidence. Noe wonder that God thereby is moved to jealouſy.</p>
               <p>To that evill, <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophers give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy little better then the diſeaſe, which is, To put confidence in ourſelves. This being a moſt erroneous Doctrine is nevertheleſſ halfe the way to the truth: for they had very well obſerved, that a wiſe wan muſt not depend from another but retire within himſelfe, where all the good and evill of a man lyeth. But while they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne a man to retire within himſelfe they leave
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170100:86"/>out the maine precept proper to a higher School then theirs, that a man ſhould ſeek God within himſelfe; and to find God in his breaſt, that he ſhould invite and then entertaine him there, by a pure ſervice, a ſincere love, &amp; an entire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence.</p>
               <p>Many, by much good Kindred, &amp; many Friends and relations, become leſſe vertuous and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious; getting the ill habit of the Italian <hi>Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi> who walking in the ſtreets beare more upon the armes of their ſupporters on both ſides, then upon their owne legs. They have need to be ſent from home to learne to ſtand alone without a Nurſe to hold them. None can be owner of any meaſure of ſtedfaſtneſſe and content that makes all his ſupport and ſatisfaction to depend of his neighbours. That man hath more content in the world, who having confined his deſire to few things, troubleth alſo but few perſons; and is deſirous of Friends to do them, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of them good offices, regarding their vertue more then their ſupport.</p>
               <p>When we have got good Friends, we muſt be prepared to loſe them. Death ſeparateth Friends, and diſolveth Mariages. When that happens, wee muſt remember without trouble or amazement that thoſe perſons ſo deare to us were mortal, but indeed that ſhould have bin remembred before. A Philoſopher viſiting his neighbour who was weeping bitterly for the death of his Wife, left him preſently, ſaying
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170100:86"/>aloud with great contempt, O great fool! did he not know before, that he had married a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man not a goddeſſe? After we have condemned that cruel incivility, yet muſt we acknowledge that it is a folly to lament for that which we knew before to be unavoydable. Yet after all reaſons, when love hath bin very deare, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration cannot but be very ſad. Teares may be permitted, not commanded to fall. And after the duty payd of a mournful Adieu to the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved perſon, we muſt remember upon what terms and condition we hold of God that which wee love beſt, even to leave it at any time when God redemands it. And if beſides we have good ground to hope, that the perſon departed is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into peace and glory, we muſt praiſe God for it; which we can hardly do, as long as our obſtinate mourning repines againſt his will. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting for thoſe that are well is ignorance, or envy, or ſelfe love. If we would not rejoyce when they were in affliction, why ſhould we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict our ſelves when they are in joy?</p>
               <p>It is ſome recompence for the death of our deare Friends, that our enemyes are mortal as well as they. A wiſe man will conſider his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes as rods in Gods hand, and minde the hand rather then the rod. To deſtroy our enemies when they are in our power is a childiſh folly, for ſo will Children burne their Mothers rod, as though there were no more rods in the world.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170100:87"/>Our enemies oftentimes do us more good then our friends, for the ſupport of our friends makes us careleſſe, but the oppoſition of our enemies makes us wary and induſtrious. They make us ſtrong and ſafe, for they make us flye to God.</p>
               <p>In nothing wiſedome is more ſeene then in judging of an adverſary. A great ſerenity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that feare make us not think him more dangerous then he is, and that pride make us not deſpiſe him, blinding our eyes not to ſee the good and evil that is in him, and what harme he may do us. It is a common and uſeful maxime for the conduct and tranquillity of mans life, that there are few great freinds, and no little ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes.</p>
               <p>When enemies are reconcileable, all things paſt muſt bee taken to the beſt by charitable interpretation. When there is no poſſibility of reconciliation, al things to come muſt be taken to the worſt; both to ſtrengthen us with reſolution within, and to encounter the evill without by prudence and vigorous wayes. In the reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we muſt pardon freely, receive ill excuſes, and if there be an offence which cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, never mention it. The remedy of injuries is oblivion.</p>
               <p>If an enemy can neither be mitigated by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor overcome by ſtrength, nor avoyded by prudence, there remaineth ſtill unto the wiſe Chriſtian an intrenchment, out of which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170100:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>be forced, which is a good conſcience, and the peace of God in it. Theſe he muſt cheriſh and keep faſt, not onely as his laſt intrenchment, but his onely poſſeſſion, and the ſtrong hold on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth keeping: It is impregnable as long as faith and love are the Garriſon.</p>

               <p>IT is the ſubject of which <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeakes moſt, and of which there was leaſt for him to ſpeak; for being doubtfull whether Death deſtroyed the ſoul or releaſed it, <hi>Mors nos aut conſumit aut e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit;</hi> and being more inclined to the firſt Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it was better for him neither to ſpeake nor to think of it. But what! others of his rank that had reaſoned before him about the immortality of the ſoul had quitted themſelves ſo meanely of that task, that out of their labours in that field, he could not reape any ſatisfaction of his doubt. This is the grand priviledge of the Chriſtian that he ſeeth life through Death, and that the laſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Nature is the date of his franchiſing, and the gate of his felicity and glory. Death that moweth downe all the hopes of this world per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth Chriſtian hope.</p>
               <p>Death is the ſeparation of body and ſoul: It is the returne of theſe two parts of man ſo different to their ſeveral principles. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Then the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170100:88"/>duſt returneth to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth unto God that gave it:</hi> Who diſpoſeth of it either in mercy or juſtice. Death is the laſt Act of the Comedy of this world. To every one Death is the end of the world in his own reſpect. In one ſenſe it is againſt nature, becauſe it deſtroyes the particular being: In another it is according to nature, for it is no leſſe natural to dye then to live. Yea Death is a conſequence of life, we muſt dye becauſe we live; and we dye, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are fick and wounded, but becauſe we are animals borne under that Law.</p>
               <p>Wherefore conſidering Death in the natural way, as <hi>Charron</hi> doth; I approove what he ſaith that we <hi>muſt expect Death in a ſteady poſture,</hi> for it is the terme of nature which continually drawes neerer and neerer. But I cannot approove that which he adds, <hi>that wee must fight againſt Death.</hi> Why ſhould we fight againſt it ſeeing we cannot ward its blowes? It is more unreaſonable then if he had ſaid that we muſt fight againſt the raine &amp; the winde, for wee may get a ſhelter from theſe, none from that: Wherefore as when it raines wee muſt let it raine, ſo when Death is coming (and it comes alwayes) wee need but let it come, not thinking it more ſtrange to live then to dye. In ſtead of fighting againſt Death, wee muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our ſelves with it. Indeed they that feare Death, muſt fight againſt that feare.</p>
               <p>Of them that feare Death there are two ſorts.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170100:88"/>Some feare it for its owne ſake: Some for that which comes after. The former which are more in number, that love the preſent world, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fixe their thoughts upon that which is to come, imagin, that when they dye they loſe all. A great folly! They cannot loſe that which is none of theirs. They have the uſe of the world only til their Leaſe be out. Death is the great proofe of that fundamentall Maxime, which I ſo often urge, and no oftner then I need; That the things that are out of the diſpoſition of our will are none of ours; and ſuch are riches, honours, our body, and life it ſelfe. To them that are ſo farre miſtaken as to thinke themſelves owners of theſe things, death is an undoing; not to them that acknowledge themſelves tenants at will, and look continually to be called out of their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement. The goods of the world are held by turnes: When you have enjoyed them a while you muſt give place to others. Make your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours caſe your owne. How ſhould yee like it, if a certaine number of men ſhould be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to monopolize to themſelves the goods of all the world for ever, to the perpetuall excluſion of all others?</p>
               <p>This reaſoning belongs to few perſons, for it preſuppoſeth plenty and proſperity. But how few have plenty? and of thoſe few againe, how few have proſperity with it? One would thinke that diſtreſſed perſons have no need of comfort
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170100:89"/>againſt death. Yet they that have the greateſt ſorrowes in the world, many times are the moſt unwilling to leave it. But certainly, if life be evill, it is good to go out of it. All men being born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of ſuffering, and miſery being univerſall in all conditions; Death which ends all miſery of life, is the greateſt benefit of Nature. Bleſſed be God, that there is no temporal miſery ſo great but hath an end.</p>
               <p>Take me a man that hath nothing but debts, that liveth meerely by his ſhifts and tricks, that hath the ſtone in the bladder and ten ſuits in Law, that flyeth from the Sergeants to his houſe, and then flyeth out of his houſe relanced by the ſcold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his perverſe wife. If in that flight he be ſuddainly killed in the ſtreet by the fall of a tyle or the overturning of a Cart, that happy misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune delivereth him from all other miſfortunes. The Sergeants overtake him and let him are All attachments and Subpoenas againſt him are vacated. Hee is no more troubled where to get his dinner. His debts breake not his perpetuall ſleep. He is thoroughly healed of the ſtone; and his wife, now deſperaetly crying becauſe ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him inſenſible for ever and unmoved at her noiſe.

                  </gap>uries. Death puts an end to endleſſe evills. It is the reſt after a continual toyle. It is the cure of the ſick, and the liberty of the ſlave. So <hi>Job</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth that quiet ſtate. <hi>Job.</hi> 3.7. <hi>There the wicked
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170100:89"/>ceaſe from troubling, and there the weary be at reſt. There the priſoners reſt together, they heare not the voyce of the oppreſſor: The ſmall and great are there, and the ſervant is free from his Maſter.</hi> It is a great folly to feare that which cannot be avoyded, but it is a greater to feare that which is to be deſired. When we have conſidered the evills of life, thoſe that we do and thoſe that we ſuffer, after that to feare Death what is it elſe but to be affraid of our reſt and deliverance? And what greater harme can one wiſh to him that will not dye, but that he may live alwayes, and be guilty and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for ever.</p>
               <p>If it be for the paine that we feare Death, for that reaſon wee ought rather to feare life, for the paines of life are farre more ſenſible then the paines of Death; if in Death there is any paine; of which I ſee no great likelyhood. For why ſhould we imagine the revulſion of the ſoul from the body to be very painful, it being knowne that the vital parts, as the heart and the liver, have little or no ſenſe: No more ſenſe hath the ſubſtance of the braines though the ſource of the ſenſes; for the head-ach is in the tuniques. When the braines is benummed and weakened, the ſenſe of paine is weaker over all the body. And generally when ſtrength decreaſeth, paine decreaſeth together. Hence it is that moſt of them that are ſick to Death, when they draw neere their end, feele themſelves very much amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170100:90"/>That ſtate is called by the Italians <hi>il megli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oramento della morte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The decay of ſenſes in that extremity is a fence againſt the troubleſome diligence, talke, &amp; cries, more troubleſome then Death, wherewith dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons are commonly perſecuted. But as a man upon the point of death is too weake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe againſt all that perſecution, he is too weak alſo to feele it much.</p>
               <p>Then, all ſuffocation is without paine, &amp; that is the moſt ordinary end of life. In the moſt violent death, paine is tolerable becauſe it is ſhort, and becauſe it is the laſt. It is a ſtorme that wracks us, but caſts us upon the haven.</p>
               <p>To that haven we muſt looke continually, and there caſt anchor betimes by a holy hope, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Death not ſo much a parting as an arrival; for unto well diſpoſed ſoules it is the haven of Salvation.</p>
               <p>The feare of that which comes after death, makes ſome mens lives bitter, and through feare of dying after Death they have already eternall death in their Conſcience. They have eyes to ſee Hell open gaping for them, but they have none to ſee the way to avoid it. In others, that feare is more moderate, and is an ill cauſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good effect, inducing or rather driving them to ſeeke, and then to embrace the grace and peace that God offers unto them in Jeſus Chriſt, and together to do good workes which are the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170100:90"/>way to the Kingdome of heaven. A man cannot afeare God too much, but he may be too deeply afraid of his Juſtice; And the feare of that death after death muſt be ſwallowed up by the faith in Jeſus Chriſt who <hi>by his death hath delivered them who through feare of death were all their life ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bondage. Heb.</hi> 2.15. He hath made death the gate of life and glory, to all that truſt in him and doe good. Godly men will not feare death; for the ſting of it is pluckt off by Chriſt. It is the terrour of evill conſciences, but the joy of the good. It is this pleaſant meditation that ſweetneth their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities and makes them joy, <hi>Our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a farre more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. The troubles of life are ſoone ended by death; and after death comes a life without trouble, and a glory without end. Men may deprive us of life, but they cannot deprive us of death; which is our deliverance.</p>
               <p>The ſame meditation will make us reliſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity when God ſends it; for none can enjoy the goods of this life with delight but he that is prepared before to leave them. Then are they delightfull when they are poſſeſt without care, and without, that which makes proſperity bitter, the feare to loſe them. Whether I have little or much let me allwayes ſay, Praiſed bee God for his temporal gifts. Here is more then I need to live and dye well. But theſe are not the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170100:91"/>goods that he promiſt me, and to which he calls me by by his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>O when ſhall that day come, when <hi>I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the goodneſſe of his houſe even of his holy Temple. Pſal.</hi> 65.4. <hi>My deſire is to depart and to be with Chriſt. Phil.</hi> 1.23.</p>
               <p>The impriſonment of our immortal Soul of heavenly nature, in a body coſingerman to the beaſt, where it lyeth heavy, drowzy and mired in the fleſh, ought to make us think that a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day, when we ſhall be awake, quickned, and ſet at liberty. Children in the womb ſleep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: Men (if you take their whole age to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) ſleep well nigh halfe their time. But after death, the ſpirit which is the true man, hath ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off all his ſleepineſſe: The faithfull ſoul is no more in darkneſſe. She receives light no more at two little loope-holes. She is all eye in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, who is all Light. She is free, holy, joyfull, all vertue, and all love, and all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for ſeeing God, and being ſeene by him, ſhe is changed into the ſame image; And to that bleſſed ſtate death is the way. Who ſo knoweth ſo much of the nature of death, &amp; yet feares it as a terrible evill, ſheweth that he is very farre within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death, which is the death of ſinne, and that he hath more fleſh then ſpirit, that is, more of the beaſt then man.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FRom that which is altogether without us and out of our power, and may be taken from us by others or by death; Let us turne our eyes within us, upon that which is more ours, our ſoule and her endowments, naturall and acquiſite, either by ſtudy or infuſion. Not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine very exactly their nature, but enough to judge of their price, and what ſatisfaction may be expected of them.</p>
               <p>Becauſe I have reſtrained ſolid content to thoſe things that are within us, and which cannot be taken from us, I acknowledge my ſelfe very much perplexed about ſome things within us, and doubtful whether they be ours or no? ſeeing that many things within us may be taken from us without our conſent, and therefore are not ours abſolutly. Is there any thing that ſeemes more ours then the illumination and dexterity of our wit, and our learning, and prudence got by ſtudy and experience? for thoſe were the goods which that Philoſopher owned with ſo much oftentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who carrying nothing but himſelf out of a Town, taken by ſtorme and pillaged, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the victor that gave him leave to carry our all his goods, I carry out all my goods along with mee. But how could he make good that poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170100:92"/>there being no Wit ſo clear, no Philoſophy ſo ſublime, but a blow upon the head, or a hot feaver may overturne it? <hi>Epictetus</hi> accounteth nothing ours but our opinions, our deſires, and our actions, becauſe theſe alone are in our power. But in an underſtanding maimed by <hi>Phrenſy,</hi> that power is loſt. It is true, it is not the ſoule but the Organe that is vitiated: But howſoever you cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of your ſoul when that organ is out of tune.</p>
               <p>Here to ſay that death will ſet the ſoul at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and then the ſpirit ſhall enjoy himſelfe, and all his ornaments, is to bring a higher queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reſolve a leſſer. For there is no doubt but that the ſpirit looſed from the matter will reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that liberty of his faculties which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by materiall cauſes; but it is a point of ſingular difficulty to judge, whether he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all the skill hee had got in this life.</p>
               <p>As for mechanicall Arts, altogether tyed to the matter, it is not likely that the ſpirit will retaine that low skill, when he liveth ſeparat from the matter. But as for higher intellectuall ſciences, it ſeemes very unreaſonable that a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit poliſht &amp; ſublimated by long ſtudy, and ſtored with a great treaſure of knowledge, ſhould loſe all in an inſtant by the death of the body, and that the ſoul of a great Naturaliſt, as my Lord of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> be left as bare of learning and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite capacity as the ſoul of a skavenger. And when the ſoul not only is made learned but
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170100:92"/>good alſo by learning, were it not lamentable that death ſhould have the power to make it worſe? Neither would holy writ preſſe this command upon us with ſo much earneſtnes, <hi>Get wiſdome, get underſtanding, forget it not,</hi> if wiſedom were an acquiſition that the ſoul muſt loſe with the body.</p>
               <p>The difficulty lyeth, in picking among the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences thoſe that will be ſure to ſtick unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat ſoul; It is much to be feared that thoſe ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which coſt moſt labour will bee ſooner loſt, and will goe out together with the lampe of life. For ſince the dead have no ſhare in al that is done under the ſun, it is like that great ſtudents who have fraught their memory with hiſtories, both antient &amp; moderne, ſhall loſe, when they dye, the remembrance of ſo many things that are done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne: By the ſame reaſon Lawyers Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſts &amp; Profeſſors of Sciences and arts depending upon humane commerce, ſhould leave all that learning behind them. But I doubt whether the contemplators of Gods works, as the Naturaliſts, ſhall loſe their learning when they dye ſeeing that it is the duty, &amp; the perfectioning of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creature to know the wiſedome and the power of the Creator, in his wonderfull workes. And I am inclined to beleeve that thoſe things that are done under the Sunne in which the dead have no ſhare, are the actions &amp; buſineſſes of men, not the workes of God; but that Naturaliſts ſhall
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170100:93"/>learne the ſcience of Gods workes in a higher and tranſcendent way. Alſo that Aſtrologers ſhall need other principles to know heaven; to which their forbidden curioſity to foretell hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane events out of the Starres, wil rather be a barre then a furtherance <hi>Nec quicquam tibi prodeſt aerias tentâſſe domos morituro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among all the ſpirituall ornaments there is one which we may be confident to keep for ever when we have it once really, &amp; therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly our owne. That rich and permanent Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is heavenly wiſedome, of which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Length of dayes is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour: Her wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſſe, and all her pathes are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaines her.</hi> That wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome conſiſteth in knowing, loving, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and truſting upon him. It is good ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wiſedome, that giveth eternal felicity and glory.</p>
               <p>We finde but two things in the interiour of man, which we may be ſure not to loſe by death: The one is the ſubſtance and intellectual faculties of our ſoul of immortal nature, which cannot be ſo offuſcated with the miſts of the fleſh but ſhe is cleared of them, when ſhe is freed of the body; The other is that ſupernatural wiſedome, when it pleaſeth God to endow our minde with it, even his knowledge, his love, conformity of our will
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170100:93"/>unto his will, and faith in his promiſes. Of other ornaments of the ſoul we cannot certainly ſay, what we ſhall keep and what we ſhall loſe. It will be therefore wifely and thriftily done to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for that which wee may be ſure to keep when we have got it; and of which, death, that takes away all other poſſeſſions, ſhall deliver us a full poſſeſſion. It is a great diſcouragment to them that ſtretch their braines upon Algebra and Logarithmes and arguments in Friſesmo, as it were upon tenterhookes, to think that all that learning ſo hard to get, will bee loſt in a moment. Who would take the paines to load himſelfe with it, ſeeing that it gives nothing but vexation in this life, and leaves in the ſoul nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit nor trace after death; unleſſe it be the guilt ſticking to the ſoul to have miſpent the ſtrength of wit upon negotious vanities, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected good ſtudies.</p>
               <p>Yet am I not ſo auſtere and peremptory as to deſpiſe all the ſpiritual endowments which we are not ſure to keep after death. For many of them are ſuch, that as we are not certaine to keep them after death, ſo we are not certaine to loſe them by death. Many of thoſe periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ornaments are nevertheleſſe good gifts of God. But our minde muſt be ſo diſpoſed that in theſe ſeveral ornaments of the ſoul we ſeek a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentment proportionate to the aſſurance that we have of their abiding with us. We are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170100:94"/>that the knowledge and love of God are permanent poſſeſſions, and impart to their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor their permanency; there then let us apply our ſtudy and place our permanent content. We are not certaine whether the other ſpiritual or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments will continue with us after this life. Then let us not beſtow our principal ſtudy about thoſe things which we are not ſure to keepe; nor place our chiefe content in them. Let the Soul loſe none of her advantages, let her glory in her eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall goods and there fixe herſelfe: Let her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce alſo in thoſe goods which ſhe hath for a time, according to their juſt value, which muſt be meaſured by their uſe.</p>
               <p>Before we conſider the ſeveral ornaments of the ſoul more particularly, we muſt conſider her ſubſtance and faculties. The Soul is immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and Spirituall bearing in her ſubſtance the image of her creator, and more yet in her facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and naturall endowments, which before her fall were in an eminent degree of perfection: for <hi>to be made after the likeneſs of God</hi> includeth all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in ſo much that this high expreſſion, to be adequate unto man, hath need to be contracted to the proportion of a created nature.</p>
               <p>Of that primitive perfection the traces are evident ſtill, in that reaſoning quickneſſe, and univerſal capacity, that goeth through all things and compaſſeth all things, that remembreth things paſt, that provideth for things to come,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170100:94"/>that inventeth, judgeth, ordereth, and brings forth ingenious and admirable workes. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal is that the ſoul is capable to know God, love him, &amp; commune with him: A priviledge ſpecial to Angels &amp; Souls of men above all creatures; as likewiſe they are the only creatures capable of permanency, which is a participation with Gods eternity, ſuch as finite natures may admit.</p>
               <p>Humility would not give us leave to conceive high enough of the price of our ſoul, but that the onely Sonne of God, God himſelfe bleſſed for evermore, hath ſhewed the high account that he made of her; So high that he thought it worth his taking the like nature in the forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and ſuffering death with the extremity of paine and ignominy, that he might recover and ſave her when ſhe had loſt herſelfe.</p>
               <p>The ſoul being of ſuch an excellent nature, and after her decayes by ſinne reſtored to her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive excellency by grace, is a rich poſſeſſion to herſelfe, when God gives us the wiſedome to obey that evangelical and truly Philoſophical precept of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.19. <hi>In your patience poſſeſſe your ſoules;</hi> not giving leave to the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of cupidity and feare to ſteal that poſſeſſion from us. But the ſoul never hath the right poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of herſelfe, till ſhe have the poſſeſſion of God. To poſſeſſe God and to poſſeſſe our ſoul is all one, for the ſpirit cannot be free, nor happy, nor his owne, but by his union with his original
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170100:95"/>Being, whereby God and the ſoul have a mutual poſſeſſion one of another; A bleſſed union begun in earth by grace, and perfected in heaven by glory. The contrary ſtate which is to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God is the perdition of a man, and the extremity of bondage, want, and miſery.</p>
               <p>Here to undertake an exact anatomy of the ſoul would be beſides my theame, and more yet beyond the poſſibility of right performance. For as the eye cannot ſee it ſelfe, the ſpirit of man cannot looke into his owne compoſure; and in all the Philoſophical diſcourſes upon that ſubject, I finde nothing but conjectural. It is more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and eaſy to learne the right government then the natural ſtructure of the ſoul. It is part of the knowledge of the ſoul, to know that ſhe cannot be known; and that her incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſſe is a lineament of her Creatours image.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of man is more quick and ſtirring then clearſighted, and many times is like a Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con that flyeth up with his hood on. He hath a good wing, but he is hood winkt. How many wits take a high flight and know not where they be? And where ſhall you finde one that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands thoroughly the matter that he ſpeakes of? The Authors that write of all animals and plants, underſtand not the nature of a caterpiller or a lettice, how then ſhall they underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of intellectual ſubſtances? Certainly all our Philoſophy of the nature of things is but ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170100:95"/>and gueſſing. <hi>Job</hi> 8.9. <hi>We are but of yeſterday and know nothing, becauſe our dayes upon earth are as a ſhadow,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bildad.</hi> Our life is a ſhadow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is tranſitory, but more becauſe it is dark. The Earth where we live is inwrapt in clouds, and our ſoul in ignorance as long as we live upon earth; and yet we are as reſolute and affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in our Opinions as if we had pitcht our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle in the Sunne: We could not ſpeak with more authority if we were poſſeſt, as God is, with the original Idea's and the very being of things. A wiſe and moderate man will not be carryed away by that preſumption, neither of others nor his owne, but with humility will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the blind and raſh nature of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man, that knoweth nothing and determines of all things, that undertakes all and brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to an end. Pure truth and full wiſedome lyeth in the boſome of the Father of lights: Our ſoules are little, unclean, narrowmouthed veſſels, uncapable to receive it but by ſmal drops, &amp; that little we receive we taint by our uncleanneſs.</p>
               <p>In our ſoul we conceive two intellectual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the underſtanding and the will; In the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding three, imagination, memory, and judgement. Imagination is that which makes all the noiſe, entreth every where, inventeth, reaſoneth, and is alwayes in action. To it we owe all the ingenious productions of eloquence and ſubtility. Its the inventor of arts and ſciences, the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170100:96"/>learner and poliſher of inventions. It is of great ſervice, and gives great content, being well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, and employed in good things. The office of imagination being to transforme itſelfe into the things that it takes for objects: it is transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into God when it applyes itſelfe unto God, and is transformed into the Father of all evil, when it applyeth itſelfe unto evill.</p>
               <p>Memory is the Exchequer of the ſoul, keeping that which the imagination and judgement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to her truſt. In the primitive ages when the world ſtood in need of inventions, a quick &amp; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile imagination made able men. But in theſe laſt ages, a well furniſht memory makes a rich and a full mind; ſo ſhe be not deſtitute of the two other faculties. In vaine doth the imagination invent and collect induſtriouſly, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prudently determine, if the memory be not a faithful keeper of the inventions of the one, and the determinations of the other, and together a ready prompter at need of that ſhe hath in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is memory that keepes this good treaſure of which the Lord Jeſus ſpeakes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.35. <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of the heart bringeth forth good things.</hi> But ſhe keepes evill as well as good, and often more firmly then good. An evill man out of the evill treaſure, of his heart brings forth evill things. Of her nature ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to good and evill, as a paper to write what one will upon and a cheſt that will keep,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170100:96"/>any thing. According to the things that are put into that cheſt, it is either a cabinet that keepes jewels, or a ſink that receives ordure. If we will have the right uſe &amp; content of our memory, we muſt furniſh her with good and holy things, that ſhe may alwayes prompt matter to our minde, to commune with God, &amp; to direct and comfort ourſelves. For when ſhe is fraught with evill and vaine matter, ſhe will thruſt evill and vaine things upon us, when the occaſion and our owne minde calls for things good and ſerious, as an idle ſervant that brings his Maſter a pare of cards when he calls for a Book of devotion. Many times we heartily deſire that we could forget certain things, which our memory importunately ſets before us on all occaſions.</p>
               <p>Judgement is the nobleſt part of the ſoul, the Chiefe Juſtice determining what the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcuſſeth, and the memory regiſtreth. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination makes witty men, memory learned men, but the Judgement makes wiſe men. The wiſe man is he that judgeth aright, not he that diſcourſeth finely, nor he that learneth well by heart.</p>
               <p>For the ſtrength of the ſeveral faculties the natural temper of the braines doth much, but ſtudy perfecteth them, the judgement eſpecially; for ſome have made themſelves a judgement by uſe and experience, who had none in a manner by nature.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:170100:97"/>
               <p>Of theſe three faculties, the Imagination, which is the ſeat of wit and invention, hath a neerer kindred with judgement, then memory with either; for wit will ripen into judgement, &amp; in diſtracted braines both are imbezelled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while memory remaines entire. It is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to ſee dull fooles have a great memory. And it is credible that the largeneſſe of the memory (eſpecially when it is ſtreacht with overmuch learning) leſſeneth the two other faculties; as in three roomes of a floore, if the one be made very wide the two others muſt of neceſſity be little.</p>
               <p>The Judgement calls all things before his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and examines them upon two points, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be true or falſe, good or evill. There he ſtayes, when the ſubject requires contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely; but when it requires action, then the determination of the judgement makes the will to move towards that which the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath pronounced to be true and good; for to move towards that which we judge to be falſe or evill, we cannot. For although our will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low many times falſe and evill objects, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alwayes conſiders them to be true and good, in ſome reſpect; Neither would our will ſo much as bend towards any object, unleſſe our judgement did before warrant it to us, true and good. Truth and falſhood have their ſprings without us: But moral good and evill, as farre as they concerne our innocency and guiltineſſe,

               </p>
               <p>Herein then lyeth wiſedome, the worker and keeper of contentment of mind, to give a ſound judgement of objects, and thereupon to give good counſell to the will for embracing that which is good, and reſiſting all oppoſitions to it by the armes of righteouſneſſe on the right hand and on the left, ſo that the ſoul, as a well balaſted and a well guided ſhip, cuts her way through the waves, and makes uſe of all winds to ſteere her courſe to the haven of ſalvation and Gods glory, poſſeſſing calme within, among the ſtormes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. But for that wiſe and bleſſed temper, there is need of a higher wiſedome then the ſtrength of Nature and the precepts of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy can afford to the judgement.</p>
               <p>By the Judgement, men are wiſe; but by the Will, they are good. Wiſedome and goodneſſe alwayes go together; when they go aſunder, they are not worthy of their name. For that man is not wiſe that inſtructeth not himſelfe to be good; and that man is not good that doeth good actions, not out of wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but out of ſuperſtition or cuſtome.</p>
               <p>The chiefe vertue of the underſtanding is the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170100:98"/>knowledge of God, and the chiefe vertue of the Will is his Love. Theſe two vertues comprehend all others, and help one another. They joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give tranquillity and content to the ſoul, when we exerciſe our ſelves in the knowledge of God, becauſe we love him; and when we love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, becauſe we know him to be moſt good, moſt wiſe, moſt perfect, and moſt worthy to be loved and obeyed.</p>
               <p>The right bent and true perfection of the will man is an entire concurrence with the will of God in all things, both to execute the will of his command and undergo the will of his decree; in both walking ſo unanimouſly with God, that man have no other will but God's. He that hath thus transformed his will into Gods will, poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a quiet and contented mind. For when we will alwayes what God willes, our will is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes done.</p>
               <p>The will is the reaſonable appetite of the ſoul; beſides which there is in the ſoul joyned with the body an appetite halfe reaſonable and halfe ſeuſitive which comprehends all the Paſſions, ſome of which have more of the reaſonable, ſome more of the ſenſitive part, according as they ſtick more or leſſe to the matter. They muſt be the ſubject of the next Book.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Of the Ornaments acquiſite of the underſtanding.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE are ſo blind at home that we know leſs our natural then our acquiſite goods: Yea without acquiſite goods we are little ſenſible of the natural goods of the ſoul. The natural Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Underſtanding, quickneſſe of wit, fidelity of memory, and ſolidity of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are ſeene onely in the acquiſitions made by ſtudy &amp; uſe, for they that trade not with that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of Nature, loſe moſt part of it and differ little from beaſts. The acquiſitions of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding may be reduced to theſe two heads; Science, and Prudence.</p>
               <p>Science is the husbandry of the ſoul, a field whoſe vertue is never knowne till it be husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Prudence is above Science in dignity, but Science precedeth Prudence in order, as the meanes go before the end.</p>
               <p>This poſition that prudence is the end, and ſciences are the meanes, gives the true light to chooſe thoſe ſciences that deſerve a ferious ſtudy. Sciences are multiplyed to a great number, and growne to a goodly perfection in this Weſterne world. They have their ſeveral uſes and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But becauſe it is impoſſible to entertaine them all, the prentiſhip being long and life ſhort, thoſe eſpecially ſhould be followed which are
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170100:99"/>wayes to true Prudence, teaching men to live well and dye well. It is the Learning, ſo much recommended by <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Take faſt hold of inſtruction, let her not go, keepe her, for ſhe is thy life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of thoſe that court learning ſome do it out of neceſſity, to get their living; They chooſe ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as they do their wives, thoſe that are fitteſt for houſekeeping. Others that have wealth and leiſure, chooſe ſciences as they chooſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, the faireſt and moſt recreative. But of ſciences as of women, the moſt recreative are not alwayes the moſt honeſt; as all ſciences that are buzy about predictions for the future.</p>
               <p>Of humane ſciences the moſt part hath more luſter then price: Learning in tongues is a fine Ornament, and of great uſe, yet not anſwerable to the labour and time that it ſtands in. When we have learned to name heaven and earth five or ſixe ſeveral wayes, we know their natures never the better for that. A wiſeman will rather ſeeke the uſe then the luſter of languages. And for his owne uſe he ought not to deny to himſelfe that innocent delight to be able to reliſh the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the tongues, which with great reaſon have the vogue among the learned; there being nothing that doth more ſweeten and poliſh the mind then good matter clad with a ſtyle ſimple and elegant, like a ſmooth and well coloured skin laid over ſtrong brawny limbes.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:170100:99"/>
               <p>There are ſtudies that have little luſter and leſſe price, and yet by their ſevere garbe go for wiſe and ſerious. Such is Schoole-philoſophy which for three or foure hundred yeares hath reigned in our Univerſities, and roughcaſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity with barbarous termes and crabbed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions. For as if Schoolemen would outdoe <hi>Pilates</hi> ſouldiers that crowned the head of our Saviour with thornes, they have habited his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with thornes all about from top to toe, ſo thick that themſelves can hardly ſee the day thorough. The writings of Schoolemen are like Labyrinths, which in a little peece of ground have a very long and intricate way. For the learning of thoſe ages being confined within a ſhort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, thoſe reſolute and irrefragable Doctors (for ſo they ſtyle one another) not being able to travel farre, and yet eager of going, did but turne and wind within their narrow limits, and croſt a thouſand times the ſame way. It is ſcarce cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible how little there is to learne in all that huge maſſe of harſh ſubtility. It is true indeed that in all ſtudies of men there is vanity, and the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſucceeded that ruſty learning hath a merryer vanity. But ſince it is ſo, that there is vainity in both, give me rather a faire and ſmooth vanity then a grimme and rugged. <hi>Si nugae, ſaltem ſint canorae.</hi> Serious fooles are the moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>Arts that regard the civil good are of ſo much
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170100:100"/>price as they bring utility to the publique, and benefit to the profeſſors. Every one muſt get skill enough in his art to be uſefull for ſociety, and to live in the world. But there are ſome ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which, though eſpecially profeſt by ſome, belong alike to all, and regard the profeſſion of man as he is man. For God hath created and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us in the world to learne three things; How the world is made, What the world doeth, And what we muſt do in the world. How the world is made, we learne by natural Philoſophy, the Sphere and Coſmography. What the world doth, we learne by Hiſtories. What muſt be done in the world we learne out of Ethicks and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques and eſpecially out of Divinity. Theſe Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are beneficial and delightful; and to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of theſe, is to live in the world not knowing for what. A prudent man will pick out of theſe what is moſt fit for his principal end, which is to glorifie God, informe his judgement, order his life, and content himſelfe.</p>
               <p>All the Learning that we lay up muſt end in Prudence. Wherefore thoſe ſtudies that forme the judgement, muſt be more carefully tended then thoſe that exerciſe the imagination. Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſciences are admirable, but this they have, that they take off the mind from matters of judgement and prudence, and fixe it altogether upon quantity and material proportion.</p>
               <p>Prudence is the guide of all vertues, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170100:100"/>before to give them light. Yea ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends them all, for nothing is ill done but for want of prudence, and the great prudence is to be religious, juſt, conſtant, and temperate. <hi>Nullum numen abeſt, ſi ſit prudentia. Solomon</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch an expreſſe charge and ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, to get prudence, thereby recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth all vertues, and above all, the feare of God which is the beginning of wiſdome. Prudence is that <hi>eye</hi> which the Lord Jeſus calls <hi>the light of the body, Matth.</hi> 6.22. that is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of life. And whereas virtues conſiſt in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a juſt temper betweene extreames, they owe that skill unto prudence, for unto it belongs the ordering and diſpoſition of things. Prudence ſheweth what is requiſite for every vertue. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence governs all the free actions of life.</p>
               <p>My end here is to know the price, not to give the rules of prudence: But thoſe Authors cannot be excuſed, that have ſet out treatiſes of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without giving any counſel for the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mans behaviour in publique or private occurrences, but onely definitions expounded at large, diviſions, and diſputations whether it be a vertue moral or intellectual, contemplative or practical, Whether the <hi>actus elicitus</hi> of prudence be to know or to will, and what difference there is betweene acting and doing. Goodly inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to forme a Councellor of State, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derprop a tottering Commonwealth. Could
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170100:101"/>theſe Doctors have done worſe for themſelves, if they had undertaken to juſtifye the ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach againſt learning, that prudence lyeth out of the circuit of Schollerſhip, and that it is incompatible with learning? This they juſtifye more yet, when they paſſe from contemplation to practiſe. For, in Councel, though but a meane corporation, tradeſmen many times will ſpeake more pertinently thet great Scholars.</p>
               <p>Of this the fault lyeth not in Learning, which is the right way to Prudence, but in not chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right learning for prudence, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones mind to other things: For neither <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents</hi> nor <hi>Modals,</hi> not <hi>Heſychius</hi> nor <hi>Suidas,</hi> nor <hi>Apogees</hi> nor <hi>Excentriques</hi> teach a man wiſedome. It were a wonder if they that never learned wiſedom, underſtood it: There are two wayes to get it, Science and Experience. Theſe men have neither, that have ſpent all their ſtudy about Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſms or Horoſcopes. But take me a Scholler that hath made prudence his ſtudy, and bent all his learning to that marke, ſeeking it firſt in Gods Book, the ſpring of all wiſedome, then in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of wiſemen both antient and late, and in hiſtory which is the Miſtriſs of life; Let him ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy men and buſineſs, as well as Bookes. Let him converſe with the wiſeſt and beſt verſed in the world, and conſummate himſelfe in experience. When ſuch a man ſhall ſpeake in a Councell of State among unlearned men, it will appeare how
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170100:101"/>raſh and injurious that ſentence is, that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prudence are incompatible; and how farre the learned go beyond the ignorant for deepe inſight into buſineſſes, and healing or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting publique evills.</p>
               <p>Becauſe we ſeek here the juſt price of things, we muſt not attribute too much unto Science and Prudence. Theſe two together make a goodly match: By knowledge and and wiſedome a man differeth from a beaſt. But both are ſubject unto vanity. For knowledge, take the verdict of two the moſt learned of all the Canonical writers, <hi>Solomon</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The firſt will tell you <hi>He that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow. Eccl.</hi> 1.18. The other, <hi>Knowledge puffeth up.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 8.1. Sorrow &amp; pride are the ordinary effects of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but when it meets with a ſtrong and meek ſpirit upheld with Gods grace. Pride will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get into thoſe that have ſome, but little learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for it is a point of ignorance for one to think he is learned when he is not. But when we are advanced in learning, we learne that we know nothing, and diſcover the uncertainty of ſciences; that they performe not what they promiſe, that new writers give the lye to the old, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.12. that <hi>of making many Bookes there is no end, and much ſtudy is a wearineſſe of the fleſh.</hi> A wiſe man that will reape from learning utility and content, muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no more of it then it can afford. He will deale with learning as with money, he will not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170100:102"/>be a ſervant to it, but make it his Servant. When he is paſt the drudgery of the Schoole, he will (if he can) make his ſtudy his paſtime, not his taske.</p>
               <p>Prudence is no leſſe ſubject to vanity then Learning, but rather hath more uncertainty. For ſciences have certain objects, ſince they conſider univerſals, which are alwayes the ſame, what change ſoever happen in the particulars. But prudence, having no object but particular things caſual and uncertaine, cannot have but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine ſeat upon ſuch an unſtayed bottome, for though there be generall rules of prudence, they muſt continually be bowed and made longer or ſhorter according to the accidents and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; which being every where different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire alſo every where a different manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. After a wiſe deliberation &amp; an induſtrions managing of a buſineſſe, an unfortunate end ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times will follow. How oft hath the moſt mature prudence bin overcome by folly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate raſhneſſe? Of which the principal cauſe is the provocation of Gods jealouſy by humane wiſedome, when it grows to preſumption. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.15. <hi>Woe unto them that ſeeke deep to hide their counſell from the Lord, and their workes are in the dark, and they ſay, Who ſeeth us? and who knowes us?</hi> For God who is called <hi>onely wiſe</hi> by St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 16.27. for which he will have him to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed for ever, is highly offended when any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170100:102"/>to ſhare in that title which is his onely, and takes a delight to blow upon projects made up with great art, to ſhew to the wiſe of the world that they are but fooles.</p>
               <p>To judge wiſely of the buſineſſes of the world, we ſhould ſee the wheels &amp; inward motions of them, but they are hidden from us. We can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pry into the counſels of men, how can we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the Decrees of God, thoſe great and ſecret motions lockt up in the cloſet of his wiſe providence? In the greateſt revolution of our age, we are eyewitneſſes how the wiſeſt counſels of a party have alwayes turned to their ruine, and the faults of State on the contrary party have alwayes bin fortunate. To one ſide prudence and imprudence have bin alike pernicious. To the other prudence and imprudence have bin alike advantageous. Let us looke up to God whoſe wayes are not our wayes, and his thoughts are not our thoughts, and againſt whoſe will no ſtrength and no counſel will hold. The future being to us a dark empty ſpace where we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no wonder that humane prudence ſeldome hits right in her forecaſt for the future. The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man hath as much advantage over the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent as one that hath good eyes over a blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but when both are in the darke one ſeeth no more then the other. Many future events are as dark to the wiſe, as to the unwiſe. And when wiſedome is moſt cleare ſighted, it can but
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170100:103"/>regulate the counſels, but cannot diſpoſe of the events.</p>
               <p>The wiſeman hath this benefit of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that if his counſels ſucceed well he can make good uſe of proſperity: And if his good counſels have an unhappy ſucceſſe, either he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the blow, or gets a lenitive to it by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and patience; or he makes advantage of it for ſome good; and which way ſoever the ſtaffe fall, he never repents of a good counſell.</p>
               <p>Of all the acquiſite endowments of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Prudence is the beſt, therefore beyond all compariſon more precious then all the goods of body and fortune: But together let us acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it hath a ſhort ſight, and a tottering bottome. Wherefore the great precept of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is, to miſtruſt our wiſedome and repoſe ourſelves upon Gods wiſedome and love. Let our prudence depend altogether upon his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>It is a great abatement of the price of humane prudence that death cuts it off with the thred of life. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.17. This was a cauſe why <hi>Solomon hated life,</hi> even becauſe the wiſeman dyeth as the foole. Yet had he wiſely pondred the matter before <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth folly as farre as light excelleth darkneſſe: The wiſemans eyes are in his head, but the foole walketh in darkneſſe: but I perceived alſo that one event happenth to them all.</hi> It is enough to diſdaine the vanity of life, and of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170100:103"/>human wiſedome better then life, to ſee a great Stateſman that made a Kingdom to flouriſh and the neighboring States to tremble, to be cut off in the midſt of his high enterpriſes and deep coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, all which dye with him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.4. <hi>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts periſh.</hi> That plotting braines from whoſe reſolution the fortune of an empire depended ſhall breed wormes and toades. And truly it ſhould be unreaſonable that this kind of prudence which hath no object but worldly and periſhable, ſhould remaine permanent. But it is very conſonant to reaſon that a higher prudence which applyeth itſelfe to permanent things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine permanent. It is that permanent wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which our Saviour recommends unto us, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.33. <hi>Provide yourſelves baggs which waxe not old, a treaſure in the heavens that faileth not.</hi> It is that wiſedome which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls <hi>a tree of life to them that lay hold on her,</hi> becauſe ſhe lives after death, and makes the ſoul live for ever. Judge you of the price of theſe two ſorts of wiſedomes; the one that periſheth, and many times makes men periſh; the other that endureth for ever, and will certainly make them that embrace her, eternally bleſſed.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe end of the inſtruction of the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is the ruling and ordering of the Will in a conſtant goodneſſe, ſo much better then ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and prudence, as the end is better then the meanes; unleſſe by prudence we underſtand that wiſedome which is employed about mans duty to God, and comprehends all vertues; for as in God all vertues are but one, which is his Being; likewiſe when we take vertues in a divine ſenſe one vertue comprehends many, as having ſome participation with the divine nature.</p>
               <p>Commonly by vertue we underſtand upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the will, becauſe without it the vertues of the underſtanding, ſcience, intelligence, and prudence, deſerve not to be called vertues, and the more able they are, the more pernicious.</p>
               <p>Vertue of all acquiſitions is the moſt precious; without it the goods of body and fortune become evills, ſerving only to make a man guilty and miſerable; for then the goods of the body give the faculty, and the goods of fortune give the opportunity to do evill; but without them Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue alone is good, and fetcheth good even out of evill.</p>
               <p>By vertue man is made like God who is the originall vertue. Vertue gives glory to God, uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170100:104"/>to the publique, tranquillity and joy to the conſcience, reliefe to ſome, counſell to others, example to all. Vertue is reſpected of all, even of them that envy it. They that love not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of vertue, yet ſtudy to get the name of it, and to put upon their falſe coyne the ſtamp of vertue. All the hypocriſie in the world is an homage that Vice payeth unto Vertue.</p>
               <p>A vertuous man may be ſtript of his eſtate by his enemies, but of his vertue he cannot. Becauſe he keepes it, he is alwayes rich. Vertue ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him in adverſity, moderates him in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, guides him in ſociety, entertaines him in his ſolitarineſſe, adviſeth him in his doubts, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports him in his weakneſſe, keeps him company in his journeyes by ſea and land. If his ſhip ſink, vertue ſinkes not; and he whether living or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaveth it and himſelfe. By vertue he feares neither life nor death, looking upon both with an equal eye, yet aſpiring to depart and to be with Chriſt; but bearing patiently the delay of his departure, becauſe he is already with Chriſt by a lively hope. Vertue ſteering the ſoule makes it take a ſtreight and ſafe courſe to heaven, and there abides with him eternally, for vertue as well as glory is <hi>that treaſure in heaven, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moth nor the ruſt corrupt, and where theeves do not breake thorough and ſteale. Math.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Philoſophy conſidereth three vertues in the wil, Juſtice, Fortitude, and Temperance, excellent
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170100:105"/>vertues, the firſt eſpecially, which in effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the two others; for it is the right temper of the will, not drawne aſide from the integrity of a good conſcience, either by oppoſitions of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity againſt which fortitude ſtands faſt, or by allurements of proſperity from which tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance witholds the appetite. Good conſcience (of which we have ſpoken in the firſt Booke) is nothing elſe but juſtice.</p>
               <p>For theſe vertues wherein mans duty and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe conſiſteth it were hard to find Elogies equal to their worth. But there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence between the excellency of Vertue in it ſelf, and ſuch vertue as is found among men. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt juſtice that man is capable of, is defective and infected with ſinne. All our righteouſneſſes are as the defiled cloath. Wherefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a juſt counterpoiſe of the will, never ſwarving either on the right hand or the left, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhaken from his ſquare <hi>cubus</hi> either by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or temptations, is a fair character fit to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, to imitate as neere as we can; as faire pictures, in the ſight of breeding women: But truly ſuch a perfect vertue ſubſiſteth not in any ſubject under heaven. In this world to be juſt, is only to be ſomewhat leſſe evill then others.</p>
               <p>If a perfect Juſtice cannot be eſtabliſht in the private policy of a mans ſoul, it is not to be lookt for in publique Policies. Juſtice being pure in her original, becomes impure and maimed being
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170100:105"/>kneaded by the weak and uncleane hands of men <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a cleane thing out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane?</hi> Of this it were eaſy to give inſtances out of the formes of Juſtice, &amp; out of the very Lawes in all States. But it is a point of juſtice to reſpect her in thoſe hands to which divine providence hath intruſted her, and to adde ſtrength to her weakeneſſe by our voluntary deference.</p>
               <p>Man being weake in juſtice, cannot but be ſo in her appurtenances, fortitude and temperance. The higheſt point unto which human precepts endeavour to raiſe fortitude is to make patience a remedy to evills remedileſs. But how ſhort the braveſt men come of that remedy in their paines and griefes, daily experience ſheweth it. The vulgar placeth the vertue of fortitude in ſtriking and maſſacring, which is rather a barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity; and if it be a vertue, tygers are more vertuous then men.</p>
               <p>As for Temperance, her very name ſounds weakeneſſe. For he that is not ſubject to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by evill ſuggeſtions, hath no need of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. That man is temperat that knoweth how to keepe himſelfe from himſelfe; who therefore is naturally evill, and prone to vicious exceſſes: Wherein men are inferiour to beaſts, which are not tempted with covetuouſneſſe &amp; deſire of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, but keepe within the bounds of nature and neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Where there is a compleat vertue, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170100:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>fortitude nor temperance; Therefore theſe are not in God, who is the original vertue. He hath no need of fortitude, for he hath no danger to overcome; and no uſe of temperance, for he hath no affection that need to be reſtrained; whence it followes that man alſo when he is once brought to his perfection of vertue which is his full union with God, ſhall have neither fortitude nor temperance, as having no evill to oppoſe, and no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>upidity to repreſſe. Juſtice is the onely vertue that outliveth the body, and lives eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with God; not that juſtice eſtabliſht in the Polities of the world, for in heaven there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelling nor contracting, which are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of communicative juſtice: And as for the diſtributive, which hath two offices, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence vertue &amp; to puniſh vice, humane juſtice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth but the laſt; recompence is accounted an act of grace, and is rare: Whereas Gods juſtice regardeth ſo much more reward then pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as a thouſand is more then three or foure, as it is expreſt in the precept againſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. <hi>Exod</hi> 20.5. and 6.</p>
               <p>That juſtice of good Chriſtians which outliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth temporall life is the uprightneſſe of their will, which in the paſſage of the ſoul to the high ſeat of perfection will be wonderfully mended and ſublimated. While the ſpirit liveth in the fleſh, though the will were never diſturbed from its uprightneſſe by the tumult of paſſions,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170100:106"/>yet it could not be raiſed to a degree of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe above the proportion of the illumination of of the underſtanding. Now the underſtanding is obſcured in this world with a miſt of errour, receiving but ſome few rayes of the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe through a cloud.</p>
               <p>I like very well the ſetting forth of a faire and compleat notion of Vertue, filling the ſoul with joy; which is not a chimera and a fiction, for every good ſoul muſt once be really brought to that perfection in his finall union with God, who is the ſoveraigne good of man, the originall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and vertue in ſubſtance. But I wiſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that while we ſet before the eyes of men, a high character of a wiſe &amp; vertuous man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat &amp; happy in himſelfe, we put them in mind of the fickly condition of mans ſoul, as long as ſhe dwels in the fleſh, that none be deceived with thoſe Idea's of imaginary perfection which <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Philoſophers aſcribe to the wiſe man living according to nature.</p>
               <p>To the Chriſtian onely it becomes well to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vertue in a perfect character, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>partaker of the divine nature,</hi> and though it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his pitch, yet to aſpire to it; for he knowes whom he hath beleeved, and where he may get a perfection <hi>exceeding abundantly above all that he askes or thinkes according to the power that worketh in him, Epheſ.</hi> 3.20. yea ſo farre as to be <hi>filled with all the fullneſſe of God.</hi> But in the mouth of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170100:107"/>Philoſophers that expect no perfection but from their own nature, nor a longer duration of their vertue then of their natural life (and of ſuch men there are more in the world then one would think) thoſe high expreſſions of the greatneſſe and happineſſe of a vertuous man are illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, unſuitable, and unbecoming; for either theſe characters are true, and then they were not made for them; or they are productions of a wild and phantaſticall pride. <hi>Seneca</hi> deſcribing his wiſe man ſaith, that he cannot be ſhaken with any thing and that he marcheth equal with God. Alas poore little man! Do but diſcharge a piſtol at his eares, though charged with powder only, you ſhall ſee that ſtout champion, which march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth equal with God, mightily ſhaken and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed in his march. There needs but the ſting of a <hi>tarantola</hi> to make him skip and dance, put his vertue out of tune, and turne all his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy upſide downe. Another was ſaying <hi>virtute mea me involvo,</hi> I wrap my ſelfe about with my vertue, as if it had bin an armour cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe and thunderbolt proofe. Though it had bin ſo, and impenetrable to temptation beſides, yet it is not impenetrable to death, for theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of nature onely, pretend not to extend the life of their vertue beyond the life of nature. To what purpoſe all thoſe bravado's for a mortal vertue; that the wiſeman is alwayes free, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes rich, alwayes happy, that he wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170100:107"/>becauſe he hath himſelfe, that he is King of the univerſe and Maſter of fortune, that in all conditions he is ſafe, ſtedfaſt, and content, and finally that he is alwayes in health; but when he hath got a cold, as <hi>Horace</hi> jeſtingly addeth. This is ſtretching man beyond man. That wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man after al that flouriſh is a calamitous creature weak, needy, unſtable, ſubject to erre, to ſinne, to ſuffer, and in the end to dye. Certainly if among all the Philoſophical vertues humility and faith be wanting, they ſerve but to puffe up a man and make him burſt and periſh. Let us before all things humble ourſelves before God, who is the onely wiſe and righteous, miſtruſting ourſelves and putting our truſt in him. Then let us ſeeke wiſedome in his wiſedome; and to frame our ſpirit upon it let us implore the aſſiſtance of his Spirit. After that, moral vertues will become eaſy to learne, and pleaſant to practiſe. They ſhall obtaine a good reward in heaven; and in earth work their own recompence.</p>

               <p>HAving lookt within and about us and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the courſe of the World in its parts, let us now behold it in the great. Which may be done two wayes, Either in the outward ſcene of mens actions, or in the inward motions of Gods
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170100:108"/>providence that are viſible to us in ſome part. In both theſe reſpects the World is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; in the former for its great variety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, in the latter for its infinite deepeneſſe.</p>
               <p>The outward face of the world is a ſtage of wickedneſſe, vanity and miſery. Wickedneſſe is univerſall; for although in Policies there be ſome face of order and juſtice, without which no ſociety can ſubſiſt; Yet if one looke to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the actions and intentions of men, the two great trades of the World are fraud and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. There is a general maxime which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man denyeth, and every man (in a manner) practiſeth, That wiſedome conſiſteth in thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by other mens harmes: Publique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate contracts, bonds, ſureties, and hoſtages, are fences againſt that generall inclination, and yet many times are imployed to execute it. All ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities both by ſtrength and law are grounded upon that Opinion that none abſtaines to do harme but he that wants power. In the beſt compoſed States governed with moſt integrity, particular intereſſe beares the ſway, howſoever publique good be pretended. Wherefore that is the beſt forme of State where the more good the Soveraine Magiſtrate doth to the publique, the more he advanceth his owne private intereſs.</p>
               <p>Rapine is the univerſal practiſe of the World. Whole Nations live of nothing elſe. Indeed the <hi>Europeans</hi> follow it with ſome outward reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170100:108"/>There is no leſſe wickedneſs among us then with the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Moores,</hi> but there is more hypocriſy. We do not robbe caravans of Merchants, and take no men upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian coaſts to make them ſlaves, but we ſuck out their blood and marrow by quillets of law, we overthrow our Country to build our houſes with the publique ruines. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. <hi>All ſeek their owne not the things of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> We give indeed that reſpect to piety and vertue that we will be reputed good, but we are afraid to be ſo. Little ſcruple is made of unlawfull profit and pleaſure, onely care is taken to do ill feats with little noiſe. The life of the World is a play where every one ſtudieth, not to do his duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but to act his part handſomly. I leave out more notorious crimes, becauſe they are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and ſet themſelves out by their infamie.</p>
               <p>To the wickedneſſe of the World is joyned vanity weakeneſſe and folly. For one cunning man there is ten thouſand Idiots, whoſe blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and raſh credulity is a ſervant to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs and ambition of a few crafty dealers. And yet the moſt crafty are not free of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of cuſtom and ſuperſtition, whereby a mans ſpirit is hooded with errour, and ſtarts at truth and good counſell. The World is a croud of giddy people juſtling one another, A company of blind people following one another and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the cloak them that go next before. If the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170100:109"/>former fall, ſo will the others; and it would be thought want of civility to ſtand when the guides are falling, or to offer to ſee when all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is winking, and to refuſe to ſinne <hi>a la mode.</hi> Youth is fooliſh, old age is doting. Orators tell us idle tales with much gravity. To pleaſe the people one muſt deceive them. The vulgar is ſet in an uproare upon light occaſions, and for light reaſons pacifyed againe. They leave the ſubſtance to runne after the ſhaddow. Paſſion not reaſon makes them turne now to evill now to good; in both the more impetuouſly, the more weakely. They have ſome good Opinion of vertue, and eſteeme it by hearſay, till it come neere, and then they cannot abide it, labouring to deſtroy vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and after they are deſtroyed eſteeming them againe, and calling for them when they are no more. Gallants are ſlaves to other mens Opinions, neglecting the duty for the ceremony, leaving health and conveniency for a conceited decency, living at a venture, and dying at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>The life of the World is a falſe game, where there is perpetual juſtling out one of another whether it be at great ſets, when one nation drives another away by invaſion, and one facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the State puts down the contrary; or by playing every one for himſelfe, each one catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what and where he can, whoſoever be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer by it.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:170100:109"/>
               <p>Out of that hideous confuſion a wofull miſery muſt needs follow in the world, where for one winner there are a hundred loſers. Man by nature is miſerable, compoſed of a ſickly body, &amp; a ſpirit that is his own tormenter. But as if all that were not enough, he is deſtroyed by his owne kind. There is but two ſorts of men in the World, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours &amp; oppreſſed; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.20. <hi>The darke places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty,</hi> which is alſo <hi>Solomons</hi> contemplation. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the oppreſſions that are done under the Sun, and beheld the teares of ſuch as were oppreſt and they had no comforter, and on the ſide of their oppreſſors there was power, but they had no comforter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I praiſed the dead, which are already dead, more then the living which are yet alive. Yea better is he then them both which hath not yet bin, who hath not ſeene the evill work that is done under the Sunne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argument of the wickedneſſe vanity and miſery of the world is ſo ample, ſo knowne, and ſo well treated by others that I may excuſe my ſelfe of further inſiſting upon it. All this is but the exteriour face of the world: But the inward motions, and the ſecret order of Gods wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct among all that diſorder, hath never bin ſufficiently conſidered; though there be enough to be ſeene on the dyal of that great clock to judge at leaſt of the wiſedome of the great work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and acknowledge that there is a deepe and divine art in that hidden machine of the counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>y,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170100:110"/>of his providence. A conſidering eye may mark how both by the concourſe and the oppoſition of ſo many free, ſtirring and diſorderly agents cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain orderly and unavoydable events are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, determined in Gods eternall decree. How many different ends and intentions which all ſerve for Gods end. Yea though they be evill, God fetcheth good from them, &amp; turnes them to his glory. Wherefore after we have thoroughly knowne the world as wicked as it is, weak, blind, confuſed, &amp; turbulent: yet let us acknowledge that all that diſorder is uſefull, &amp; that among ſo much evill there is nothing but doeth good. The inſolency of ſome ſerves to exerciſe the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of others and forme them to vertue. Gods indulgence powring plenty into the mouthes that blaſpheme him teacheth his children to do good to their enemies, and not to be more haſty then God to ſee juſtice executed on the wicked. It is a goodly ſtudy to be a diſciple of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>Conſider how the States of the World are maintained by their own diſeaſes. <hi>France</hi> is ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with poore and vagrants, and idleneſſe is thought there to be eſſential to gentile blood; but hence it comes that the King gets armies as ſoon as the drum beats, and is the terrour of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and ſupport of his friends, Whilſt other States whoſe policy is ſo provident as to leave neither poore nor idle perſon among them, are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170100:110"/>put to hire ſouldiers of all nations with great labour and coſt, and commit their ſafety to outlandiſh and uninterreſſed ſouldiers. States as well as wine have need of ſome lees for their perſervation. Among the <hi>Turks, Muſcovites,</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> the tyrannicall unlimited power of the Soveraine and the blind obedience of the people, keep the State in peace which otherwiſe would be torne with civil warres. Groſſe ſtupid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance keeps ſome nations in concord at home; Whilſt other nations by their wit and learning are diſquieted with endleſſe factions. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage and uncivill humour of ſome people makes them conſiderable, and they are reſpected of all becauſe they reſpect no body. Many times a State by a forraine invaſion, and by diviſions at home hath learned to know his ſtrength, and is become warlike and formidable to his neighbours. The naturall want of neceſſary things in a Country, too little for the many inhabitants, have cauſed the people to traffique over all the world, and made the abundance of all regions tributary to their vertue. Covetouſneſs penetrates both the Indies, and compaſſeth the world about like the Sunne, to bring us pearles to hang at the eares of our Miſtreſſes, and pepper to ſtrow over our cucumbers. For that end great companies of Merchants are aſſociated, and the fortunes of Princes and Commonwealthes are ventured in in great Sea-fights. But out of that hazardous
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170100:111"/>folly which certainly is a great diſeaſe of the mind, a great bulke of new knowledge in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things accreweth to the publique ſtock of learning, and thereby a great gate is open for the propagation of the Goſpell. So admirable is Gods providenee, who by ſmall weights ſetts great wheeles on going, and makes uſe of the vanity and unſatiable greedineſs of men to bring neere the remoteſt parts of the world by the bond of commerce, and advance his Kingdome. Thus among the giddineſs of publique commotions, the iniquity of great actions, and the vanity of their motives, the wiſedome and goodneſſe of the firſt cauſe brings under his ſubjection, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the wickedneſſe of inferiour agents. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Deſtruction and miſery is in their wayes and the wayes of peace they have not knowne:</hi> But they are in Gods hand, who will bring all to a good end.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why we complaine of the badneſs of the time is that we ſee but one peece of it. But God that beholds with one aſpect the whole courſe of time from its ſpring in the creation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouth where that great river diſgorgeth itſelfe into the Sea of eternity, ſeeth that all which ſeemeth evill by parcells is good when all parts are taken together. And not onely he beholds it, but he conducts it moſt wiſely, and to that wiſe conduct we muſt humbly leave the rectifying of all that ſeemes amiſs to us in the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170100:111"/>courſe of the times. It is a great comfort to our mind, and a great help to our judgement in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique diſorders and private croſſes, that we may be certaine that God is an agent above all agents in all things, even in the worſt, which he makes inſtruments; to ſome of his juſtice, to others of his bounty, to all of his wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Among ſo much evill yet there is ſome vertue in the world, and where it is not obeyed yet it is reſpected. If the torrent of the perverſity of the time becomes ſo rapid that good men cannot row againſt it to any preferment, it will never barre them from all havens of retreat; and to force them to a retreat many times it is to compell them to their good and reſt; for as they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the favour of great men, they are freer alſo from their factions. During the tempeſt one may ſleep at the noiſe of the waves. There is no place ſo unſafe and full of trouble, but the God of peace may bee found in it; And they that truſt in him, repoſe themſelves ſafe and quiet under his wing. The world ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſo wicked and ſo contrary to good men but that they may do good to the world againſt its will.</p>
               <p>One thing muſt make us looke kindly upon this world, that it is the Hall of Gods houſe, where we waite expecting to be advanced to Gods preſence; and all things that happen to us in this life helpe to bring us to that Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170100:112"/>All creatures not corrupted by ſinne ſpeak to us of God. Yea every thing, good and bad, gives us matter to lift up our thoughts unto God. Nature ſmiles upon them that love God. Then his law directs us, His promiſes comfort us, He guides us by his Spirit. He covers us by his providence. He ſhewes us from above the prize kept for us at the end of the race. By which meanes we are leſſe weary of the world then they that ground their hopes upon it. And after we have balanced with a calme judgement the good and evil that is in the world, we finde that the world goeth better with the good then with the bad; life cannot be very bad, if it be a mans voyage to God.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He right employment of a Chriſtian Philoſopher that will have peace at home is to calme the tumult of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the ſenſitive Appetite is in the ſoule as the common people in a State. It is the dregs and the loweſt part of the ſpirit, that hath a neere affinity with the outward ſenſe, greedy, raſh, tumultuous, prone to diſcontent and munity. Reaſon in a mans ſoul holds the place of a Soveraine, which many times is ill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. She is like the coachman, and the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons like the horſes, fierce and hardmouthed, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hard againſt the bridle, which many times they pluck out of her hands.</p>
               <p>Of this a cauſe is given, which is natural and good. That the firſt yeares of life before a man be capable of the uſe of reaſon are altogether under the empire of the Appetite, which being uſed to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170100:113"/>rule doth not willingly become a ſubject to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when age and inſtruction awake that higher faculty; and in many that rebellion holds till they be farre gone in their life, or to the very end. Wherefore it will be a wiſe part to tame the opiniatre appetite of children, beginning at the firſt yeare of their life, to teach their eager will to bee denyed. He that was uſed to yeeld to his Nurſe, hath already taken a ply of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and will more readily bow to reaſon when age brings it.</p>
               <p>That tender age breeds another cauſe of the diſobedience of Paſſions to right reaſon: That the childs judgement is dyed with falſe Opinions of the objects which his appetite imbraceth. For in the age when the Appetite is ſole regent in the ſoul, the Fancy and the Memory are filled with images proportionate to the outward appearance, making the child take all that is guilded for maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy gold, all glittering things for precious, and feathers and ſugar plums for the Soveraigne good. Which firſt imaginations, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cleared of their groſſeſt fogge by age and experience, yet leave theſe falſe notions in the minde, that things are within ſuch as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare without: and that wealth gallantry and the pleaſure of the taſte, are the beſt things of the world; Opinions which preſently prove ſeeds of covetuouſneſſe ambition and luxury, which in ſhort time (as all ill woedes) will grow
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170100:113"/>ſtrong and fill the ſoul with trouble and miſery.</p>
               <p>Then the firſt, yea the onely courſe to free the Appetite of vicious Paſſions, is to heale the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of erroneous Opinions. The Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite cannot but goe aſtray when the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is blind. When the underſtanding is free of error, the Appetite is free of Vice. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many times Paſſion runne into diſorder contrary to the light of the underſtanding, that never hapens but when the underſtanding hath conſented for a while to ſome falſe opinion ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by flattery of Paſſion, that ſtroakes him and puts her hand before his eyes; for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Appetite to embrace that which Reaſon ſeeth and pronounceth to be altogether evill.</p>
               <p>The great error of the underſtanding, which makes the paſſion to apply it ſelfe to an evill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or to a good object otherwiſe then it ſhould, is a miſtake in the true price &amp; true inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of things; Which being once well knowne, we ſhall bate much of our deſire &amp; feare of moſt things which we ſeek or avoid with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe, and ſhall become earneſt to get other things which we neglect, and to avoid other things which we deſire.</p>
               <p>I have endeavored in my ſecond Book to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the juſt price of the chief things that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eſteem &amp; deſire, &amp; the true inconvenience of things that we diſeſteeme or feare. But becauſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170100:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>it would be an endleſſe labour to treat of all the ſeverall objects of our Paſſions, I will but recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to every perſon that loves the cleereneſſe and tranquillity of his mind, never to ſet his love and deſire upon any thing, before a mature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of what it is and what it is worth, and never to be angry or ſorry for any thing before we hath calmly &amp; leaſurely examined whether it be evill, and if ſo, then in what meaſure; weighing as carefully and impartially the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and circumſtances that contradict our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination as thoſe that contribute towards it. Thus he that delights in a glaſſe muſt remember well that it is a glaſſe; &amp; after he hath ſufficiently conſidered the pureneſſe of the matter and the handſomeneſſe of the faſhion, he muſt conſider alſo that it is brittle ſtuffe, and that it will laſt but till the next knock; So ſhall he learne to love it according to its true price, and no more; his love will laſt no longer then the glaſſe, and when it is broken he will ſay, I knew before that it was a glaſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo to love and deſire a deare perſon as much as it is fit, and no more, we muſt well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider her nature and juſt value; And when Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will overvalue her with Idea's of perfection above her juſt ſize, Reaſon will bate of it, ſaying, With al this perfection ſhe is a humane creature, and therefore faulty, mutable and mortal, and as ſuch I muſt deſire her before I have her, cheriſh
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170100:114"/>her when I have her, and mourne for her when ſhe is taken from me. Let us proportion our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the quality of the ſubject, and we ſhall love it as we ought.</p>
               <p>Thus for other Paſſions, right Opinion is the moderator. It keeps feare from increaſing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, pride and raſhneſſe from leſſening them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and choller from making our enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more deformed and guilty then they are, ſadneſſe from aggravating evils, joy from diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of falſe hopes. In a word, right opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is the faithfull guide of the appetite, the rule of equity, the preſerver of tranquillity.</p>
               <p>But becauſe when the objects ſhew themſelves the violent commotion of the paſſion, without warrant from the judgement many times will ſhake reaſon from right Opinion; it muſt be ſtudied upon, when the mind is at reſt, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon confirmed in it by long and carefull inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtrengthened by holy reſolution.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing of which we muſt have a right opinion, is God: Not to preſume to comprehend the Incomprehenſible, but to have a reverend beleefe of his goodneſs, juſtice, power, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, of his conſtancy in his promiſes and love; and of his eyes ever open and bent towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> both to keep us &amp; to take notice of our thoughts, words, actions, and affections.</p>
               <p>The next thing of which we muſt be carefull to get a right opinion is our ſelves, to know our
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170100:115"/>owne ſtrength, that we repoſe not a groundleſs truſt upon it, and to marke the weakeſt places of our ſoules, and thoſe avenues by which tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſet upon our paſſion, that there we may double our guard.</p>
               <p>Then we muſt endeavour to get a right opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the courſe of the world, the genius of the times, and the nature of men and buſineſſes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of thoſe men that we muſt converſe with, and of the buſineſſes that concerne us. Of thoſe things alſo that uſe to flatter or fright our Paſſion, leſt we bee more moved to get or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd them then they are worth, and leſt we neglect them if they be worth ſeeking or ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>Thus in matter of ſeeking Preferment we muſt think ſoberly before, whether it be worth the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary paines to get it, and whether it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe the cares, the envy, and the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that attend it. The like when we are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by unlawfull profit and pleaſure, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that is hoped by it muſt be calmely weighed with the diſadvantage of diſpleaſing God and troubling our conſcience. And ſo when anger ſets us upon revenge, we muſt endeavour to get the right Opinion of the uſe of revenge, what comfort, what benefit it may bring, and whether meekneſſe &amp; pardon of the offence for Gods ſake be not more capable and likely to bring us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and real utility.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:170100:115"/>
               <p>It is an old and a wiſe counſel to make a pauſe every time that we feele ſome ſtrong commotion in our appetite, to give time to reaſon to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it. That pauſe muſt be employed to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the clouds that Paſſion ſpreads before the eyes of the underſtanding, and help reaſon to recover the ſight of right Opinion, that we may obey that wiſe and rational command of the Lord Jeſus <hi>John</hi> 7.24. <hi>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgement.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Entry into the diſcourſe of Paſſions.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MY end is to bring Paſſions under the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of right reaſon, not to deſcribe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly their nature. A task where Naturaliſts come ſhort of performance; And no wonder, ſince they take a ſubject in hand where reaſon ſeeth nothing, as if one would make an Anatomie in the darke; for in nothing is our ſoul ſo blind as in the compoſure of herſelfe: Yea the trueſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural contemplation of Paſſions is of no great uſe to governe them: What doth it concern him that ſtudyeth the moderation and the right uſe of Paſſions to know that Joy comes by dilatation of the ſpirits, Sadneſſe by contraction of the ſame, Love by diffuſion, Hope by elevation? For my part becauſe I ſeeke utility, I will be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to finde the morall counſels by which Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170100:116"/>are moderated, then the natural wayes by which they are moved. And if in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe of Paſſions I keepe not exactly the order and number received in the Schooles, or treate of ſome mixt Paſſion among the ſimple, it will not be out of ſingularity, but becauſe I underſtand not perfectly thoſe diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing to be conſidered about Paſſion is whether we muſt have any, or utterly deſtroy it, as the <hi>Stoicians</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> would do. This queſtion, whether we may have Paſſion with vertue, is as if one asked whether there may be wooll with cloth, for Paſſion is the ſtuffe of Vertue, and Vertue is but a paſſion wiſely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated: If there were no Paſſion there would be no vertue. If then the Paſſion be ſick, it muſt be healed, not ſlaine, and much leſſe muſt it be ſlaine when it is in health leſt it fall ſick.</p>
               <p>It may be ſayd for the Philoſophers that would cut off or rather root out Paſſion, that it is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour that doth little harme: for man being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally too paſſionate we muſt pull to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary extreme to bring him to a vertuous mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for after we have rooted it out as much as may be, there will remaine ſtill too much of it.</p>
               <p>Beaſts have alſo their Paſſions, and by them men are allyed with beaſts. But the Appetite of the beaſt is meerly ſenſual, the appetite of man is partly ſenſual partly intellectual. Paſſions may be marſhalled into three orders, according
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170100:116"/>to the three principall faculties of the ſoul; The inferiour order is of them that are onely in the ſenſitive Appetite, and have their motions for the body onely, as hunger and thirſt; Over theſe reaſon hath leſſe power, for ſhe cannot perſwade him that is hungry not to be ſo, but ſhe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the ſatisfaction of the appetite.</p>
               <p>Other Paſſions are lodged in a higher ſtorie, and ſeeme to be ſeated in the Imagination, as the Paſſion that one hath for curioſities and images of perfection increaſed by the deſire. Theſe are more capable to be ruled by reaſon.</p>
               <p>The third and higheſt order is of intellectual paſſions, as the love of learning and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe are more immediately in the power of reaſon. It is the part of reaſon to forme and moderate thoſe paſſions which are meerely under her juriſdiction, and keepe a ſhort bridle to thoſe paſſions that are moved without her leave, by nature, chance, or fancy.</p>
               <p>As in a well governed kingdome all is done by the King, the faculties of the ſoul muſt be kept in ſuch order that within us all be done by Reaſon: When that Soveraine is wiſe and well obeyed, peace is in the inward State of man. But when the Soveraine is made ſubject to his natural Subjects, the ſenſual Paſſions; then the ſoule is like a body with the heeles upward, and the whole policy of the mind is turned upſide downe.</p>
               <p>Being to ſpeake of the Paſſions as the winds
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170100:117"/>that ſtirre and toſſe that inward ſea of the ſoule, I muſt alſo ſpeake of the Vertues that ſerve to repreſſe them. Not to treate of each ſeverally and prolixely, but to bring them to action, and to miniſter to every Paſſion its proper remedy.</p>

               </head>
               <p>LOve is the firſt of all Paſſions, and the cauſe of moſt part of them. It is the motion of the ſoule towards objects that promiſe reſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenument. By Love men are good or evill happy or unhappy, as that Paſſion is applyed to good or evill objects.</p>
               <p>In every ſoule there is a Maſter-love which beares rule over all the other Paſſions and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth them to its principal object. According to the quality of that object, love is perfect or unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for as the objects of the ſight change in ſome ſort the apple of the eye into their colour and ſhape, ſo by receiving the image of the beloved object into our ſoule, our ſoule is tranſformed into it, and wedded to its qualities. He that loves a ſordid thing becomes ſordid. Doth any love his hounds with that principal love? his ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the ſame quality as his hounds. He that loveth a high object becomes high by that love. He that loveth God the ſoveraine good receiveth the ſoveraine good into his ſoule.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:170100:117"/>
               <p>Many cauſes contribute to the contentment of minde but the chiefe cauſe of it is a worthy love. And it may be truly ſayd that neither in heaven nor in earth any thing is pleaſant and contenting but Love. <hi>God</hi> himſelfe <hi>is love,</hi> ſaith St <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.16. And I conceive (as much as a finite mind dares conceive of the infinite God) that in the ſubſtantial love embracing the three perſons of the Godhead conſiſteth both their perſonal union and their felicity.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken before of the vertue of love which unites us with God, and ſhewed that it is mans great duty and ſoverain felicity. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I muſt ſpeake of the Chriſtian love due to our neighbours which is called charity; and of the love of ſociety which is friendſhip. In all theſe relations love is a vertue, either acquiſite or infuſed. But here wee conſider it as a natural Paſſion, which yet wee muſt endeavour to raiſe to a vertue, and for that wee cannot but returne againe to the love of God.</p>
               <p>The moſt natural love is the love of the ſexe. A Paſſion meerely ſenſual, and common to men with beaſts. And yet it is that Paſſion which keepes the greateſt ſtirre in mans heart and in the world. That love ſofteneth magnanimous ſpirits, and drawes downe the ſoule from the heaven of holy meditation to the dregs of the matter. But for that Paſſion, a man might come to a degree of Angelical purity in this world. Wherefore there

                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:170100:119"/>is great need to learne how to repreſſe it. To roote it out (if one could find in his heart to doe it) would be deſtroying nature, and reſiſting the ordinance of God, who gave that inclination to all animals for the propagation of their kind. But becauſe God gave alſo reaſon to men above other animals, and his knowledge to Chriſtians above other men; the love of the Sexe hath need to be led by a better guide then Nature, elſe it is bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, and that which is innocent in beaſts is vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in men. By it men inſtead of the pleaſure which they hunt after ſo hotly, find ſadnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, infamy, deſtruction of body ſoule and eſtate. It is a feareful ſentence that <hi>no whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nor uncleane perſon hath any inheritance in the kingdome of Chriſt and of God. Epheſ.</hi> 5.5.</p>
               <p>It is a criminal &amp; deplorable folly to turne into a ſnare of damnation that volupty which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of the wiſe creatour hath given to all animals to invite them to the continuation of themſelves in their poſterity; and to climb up at the window with perill to ſteale pleaſure with crime, whileſt marriage opens the doore to it, unto which God, men, honeſty, duty, utility, and facility, invite us.</p>
               <p>Love altogether carnal doth not affect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but the pleaſure, unleſs by the perſon a mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe be underſtood. Love of beauty is love of onesſelfe, not of the deſired perſon, ſince beauty is deſired for pleaſure. When that love of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170100:119"/>ſexe is joyned with a true affection to the perſon, and that affection grounded in vertue, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with mutual love, then love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip meete and increaſe one another; And if mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage followeth, it may prove the greateſt of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral contentments.</p>
               <p>But as in unlawfull love there is need of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to refraine it, ſo in the lawful there is need of temperance to moderate it. Temperance is the preſerver of love, &amp; of pleaſure alſo; Both are loſt by exceſſe. As the flame of a taper turned upſide downe is quencht by the ſubſtance that feeds it, ſo love goeth out by too much plenty of aliment. But though love and pleaſure could maintaine themſelves in the exceſſe, neither body nor mind loſing any thing of their vigour, yet there would be more loſſe then gaine in it; for fervent paſſion troubleth the ſerenitie of the ſoul, and any thing that ſubjecteth the underſtanding to the appetite degradeth the ſoule of her excellency, eſpecially when the appetite is meerely ſenſual.</p>
               <p>Becauſe in conjugal life two loves meete, the love of the ſexe, and the love of ſociety, It will be a wiſe courſe, to tye the laſt with all the bonds of benevolence. Theſe bonds are piety, ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, tender care of the beloved perſon, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to beare with her infirmities, and a little winking not to ſee all that might diminiſh love, omitting nothing to make the beſt of a bargaine which cannot be undone. That indiſſoluble knot
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170100:120"/>which unto fooles makes marriage a heavy yoake, is unto the wiſe a helpe to contentment, for by that neceſſity they are taught to love what they muſt love, &amp; to ſeeke their delight in their duty.</p>
               <p>The greateſt fervour of love is not in matrimony, for there one hath alwayes at hand wherewith to coole his thirſt; nor in unlawfull luſt, where alſo one knowes how to allay his heat, though with the detriment of his conſcience; but in woing, &amp; in longing deſires tending to mariage. That heat is increaſed by the lawfulnes of the end, and the ſuggeſtion of a bewitched reaſon unto the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that one that loveth honeſtly cannot love too much: And if that heat meet with oppoſition, it increaſeth againe by difficulty, and often there is more love where there is leſſe hope. <hi>Quó que minùs ſperat, hôc magis ille cupit.</hi> Paſſion will frame in a mans fancy an advantageous image of the beloved object which ſtands continually before him; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him in dreames, breakes his ſleepe, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts his beſt thoughts, and his moſt important buſineſſes, makes his ſpirit a ſea in perpetual agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and his moſt quiet intervalls are ſadnes and a browne ſtudy. The worſt is, that God is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and the love of heaven is put out by the love of the world.</p>
               <p>Many not onely of the vulgar ſort but of the braveſt mindes having ſplit their ſhip upon this rock, there is need of extraordinary care to avoyd it. So much greater, becauſe our Chriſtian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170100:120"/>have taken leſſe care to appropriate their remedies to this ſickneſſe; for when they inveigh againſt carnal and vicious love, thoſe lovers who are perſuaded that their love is all vertuous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not though they could, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully poſſeſſe the beloved perſon, eſteeme that theſe cenſures belong not to them: And yet, God knoweth that their love is too carnal, though they were virgins in their very thoughts, for even the immoderate love of a mother to her child is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and vicious.</p>
               <p>They need then to be put in mind that their love cannot be pure in the quality, as long as it exceeds in the quantity, exceſſe of love for a worldly object being a moſt impure quality; for that Maſter-love which rules in the ſoul and brings all other Paſſions under, is due unto God alone, who will be loved with all our heart, with all our ſoul, with all our ſtrength, and with all our underſtanding. This the Lord Jeſus calls <hi>the firſt and the great commandement. The great,</hi> becauſe it is the chiefe duty of man, which comprehends all other duties. And <hi>the firſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a comment upon the firſt precept of the law, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other Gods but me.</hi> As then we muſt adore none but God alone, we muſt love none but God alone with that Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love which gives to another the ſoverainty over ourſelves; for that love is a true adoration, whereby all the faculties of the ſoul bow and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170100:121"/>proſtrate themſelves before the beloved object. When carnall love is the Maſter-love in a ſoul, then the ſoul hath another God then the true God; and that Paſſion makes a burnt-offering of the heart to a falſe God, ſome weake ſinfull creature. Certainly thoſe impetuous burning fits of carnal love are violent rapines of the proper rights of God, for to him belongeth the heart, and upon him thoſe raptures and ſtrong agitations of love ſhould have beene beſtowed; him onely we ought to love with all our ſoul and with all our ſtrength. O how farre are theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences from thoſe which muſt take the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God by force! And how many teares and plaints of ſmarting remorſe muſt fond lovers powre, to doe penance for ſo many teares and plaints of carnal love, that opinatre imbecillity, whereby a man pines and torments himſelfe for the love of another!</p>
               <p>Sometimes theſe two ſorts of teares proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of ſuch different cauſes have met together in generous and religious ſoules, who being tranſported with thoſe violences of humane love were at the ſame time ſtrongly moved with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jealouſy, the conſcience grieving and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulating with the Appetite for yeelding unto any but God the ſeignory of the heart: Then the love of God oppreſt in the heart under the weight of the world and the fleſh, powerfully beſtirred himſelfe, and getting ſtrength by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170100:121"/>overcame that rivall love, and became in the end Maſter of the place.</p>
               <p>But alas, one victory doth not end the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; For carnal love, when we think that it is ſhut out, will re-enter, having the porters of the ſoul, the ſenſes, on his ſide, which open the gate to its objects without the leave of reaſon, and help it to make ſtrong impreſſions upon the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; Whereas the immaterial beauty of God hath no help from the ſenſes, &amp; makes no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the imagination; but in recompenſe it doth immediately illuminate the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and work upon the affections, and ſo ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth and ſtrengtheneth them, that after many combats, carnall love is ſubdued; And if it pleade nature for ſtaying with us, yet it is brought to ſuch a ſubjection that it moveth no more but orderly, and within the limits of piety and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, poſſeſſing but ſuch a parcel of the affection as it pleaſeth the love of God to allow nature to hold under him.</p>
               <p>The limits and rules of reaſon about the choice of the ſubject of that love are poſſibility, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, and conveniency. The meaſure of love muſt be according to the price of the ſubject. But when it comes to wedlock another meaſure is requiſite, that of oblgiation and duty; before wedlock, love is prone to overvalue his ſubject: Let lovers remember that the moſt perfect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are humane creatures, therefore a humane
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170100:122"/>love is fit for them, not a divine ſervice; for then we ſerve them as God alone muſt be ſerved, when we make them Miſtriſſes of our heart, Take the beſt of them, their beauty will fade, their ſweetneſſe will ſowre, and their perſons muſt dye; this bates much of their price. Faire Diamonds would not be ſo deare, if they could grow pale and weare out. Know once the moſt lovely perſons, you ſhall not admit them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with God for the poſſeſſion of your heart.</p>
               <p>Love aſpireth to perfection. He then muſt be beloved above all things who makes them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that love him. It is more then Ladies can do, though never ſo perfect. But by loving God who is the ſoveraine perfection, we become like him in our meaſure and are changed into the ſame image.</p>
               <p>And ſince delight is the baite of love, we muſt love him above all things that ſatisfyeth us with true delight. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.12. God <hi>in whoſe preſence is fulneſſe of joy, at whoſe right hand there are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore.</hi> Carnall love makes the heart ſick. It is ſullen, fantaſticall and tumultuous. It conceives great hopes of content and comes ſhort of them; It gives for one pleaſure a thouſand ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. But the love of God is a continuall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, a conſtant peace, a ſolid joy; and if ſometimes one ſuffer for him, he repayes for one ſorrow a thouſand pleaſures.</p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:170100:122"/>
               <p>Many lovers of beauties are not beloved of them. But who ſo loveth God muſt be ſure that God loves him. Yea that God loved him before he loved God; the love which he beares to God is an effect of the love which God beares to him. And is it not a great encouragement to love, when one is ſure to be accepted and beloved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? That ſubject which onely deſerves to be loved with all our heart is eaſy to be wonne to a mutual love: Other objects of our love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely under that prime ſubject, are farre more difficult to winne.</p>
               <p>Our love of God is not croſt with abſence as the carnall. For him we fetch no unheard ſighes, and ſhead no unſeen teares. God is alwayes neare them that ſigh for him, and <hi>puts up their teares in his bottle. Pſal.</hi> 56. <hi>The Lord is nigh to all that call upon him.</hi> He travelleth with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, He keepes houſe with them, yea in them; He ſweetens their griefes, he anſwereth not only then words but their very thoughts.</p>
               <p>Many times we love them that can do us no good, though they love us; many times alſo we are impoveriſhed by the love wee beare them. But our love to God makes us rich, for it gets al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready poſſeſſion of God, who is the Author of all good gifts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.10. <hi>With him is the fountaine of life, and in his light we ſee light.</hi> To love him is to raiſe ourſelves to ſoveraine honour and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:170100:123"/>
               <p>Briefly if one will have favours, gratious countenance, ſweet individuall company, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, enjoyment, fullneſſe of joy for ever, let him turne the point of his love heavenwards. Divine love will make him good and happy in the higheſt degree. Theſe benefits are not to be expected of carnal love. A ſickneſſe which is the ſame in the appetite as a fever is in the blood, ſometimes in a cold, ſomtimes in a hot fit. It is a perpetuall ebbe &amp; flow of feare and hope, and it cannot but be continually ſhaking and wavering, ſince it pinnes the felicity of a man upon another, who hath not felicity, enflaming his heart to a ſubject weaker many times, and more neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous then himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And if theſe inconveniences be found in the honeſteſt love of the ſexe, how much more in the unlawfull and unchaſt love?</p>
               <p>Of this ſickneſſe the moſt uſuall but not the beſt remedy is to drive out one Miſtreſſe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; but the way to get liberty is not to change ſervice. In ſtead of getting out of the ſtorme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a harbour, they are toſſed from one rock to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. He then that will expell one love by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother love, muſt betake himſelfe to a love that may change his ſervitude into liberty, which the love of God will afford, and none elſe. So the grand remedy of carnall love is to exerciſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the love of God, and gladly to conſider what a ſacrilegious part it is to erect a little idol
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170100:123"/>of our ſenſuall appetite in our heart which is Gods Sanctuary, and what a hainous rebellion it is to chuſe another Maſter then God.</p>
               <p>Thence (without an extraordinary mercy of God) one of theſe two evills will follow. Either God, jealous that we love another more then him to whom all our love is due, croſſeth our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and makes us miſſe that which we ſought after with ſo much eagerneſſe: Or, in a greater indignation he gives us that which we preferre before him, and whence we expect our higheſt happineſſe, which afterwards turnes into bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ruine. You ſhal ſee many impetuous corrivals, ſuitors of an evill woman, as fiſhes juſtling one another, ſtriving for a mortall bayte; The ſtrongeſt and moſt unfortunate driveth he other away, and by taking is taken and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Solomon</hi> who had but too much experience in this matter gives this account of it. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.26. <hi>I find more bitter then death the Woman whoſe heart is ſnares and nets, and her hands as bands. Who ſo pleaſeth God ſhall eſcape from her, but the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall be taken by her.</hi> Women might ſay little leſs of men. There is no cheat, no witchcraft, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that of carnall love, neither is there any thing that workes ſadder effects. Of which the moſt ordinary is, the loſs of the tranquillity of the ſoul. A loſſe not to be recompenſed by all the love-pleaſures that luſt can ſuggeſt to the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:170100:124"/>
               <p>No Paſſion ſinnes more againſt that rule truly Chriſtian and Philoſophical, to <hi>dwell at home,</hi> and not to ſeek our content out of ourſelves, which is the ſame thing as to ſeeke it in God, for in God is our true being, and God is found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, if we have the grace to ſeeke him there, as we ought. But carnall love makes a man to ſeeke all contentment out of God and out of himſelfe, ſo that he is never at home, alwayes abroad, and alwayes under the power of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Neither doeth any other Paſſion ſo enormouſly tranſgreſſe in the two extreames, both to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value and undervalue the price of things. For a lover will raiſe the price of the beloved object above Nature and poſſibility; and together caſt away his eſtate, his honour, his conſcience, and hazard his life, as things of no account, to get that idolized object.</p>
               <p>It were a wonder if young people, being all naturally enclined to that burning fever did not get it after ſo much paines taken to bring them to it. For how many bookes are written for that very end? How many amorous fables, which to write and to reade is the buſines of them that have none? There young men are taught, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue conſiſteth in being paſſionate beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and that great feats of armes and high fortunes and atchievments are onely for lovers. There maides learne to be deſperately in love,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170100:124"/>diſembling, proud, and bloody, and to beleeve that all is due to their ſupremacy, ſeing in thoſe bookes the world torne with warres by the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of ſome Princes lovers and rivals, and many thouſands of mens lives ſacrificed to the faire eyes of a Lady. There alſo they learne to be crafty Miſtreſſes and ill wives; they have need to learne obedience, but in theſe bookes they learne ſoverainty. Women being more given to theſe bookes then men, ſhew that though they have leſſe fougve of love then men, they have nevertheleſſe a more conſtant inclination to it.</p>
               <p>Who ſo will keepe himſelfe holy in body and affection and preſerve his ſoule ſerene and free from the tempeſt of that turbulent Paſſion, muſt avoid the reading of ſuch bookes whoſe proper office is to raiſe thoſe ſtormes in a mans blood and appetite. And I know not whether it be more dangerous to reade diſſolute bookes which make of carnal love a jigg and a matter of ſport, openly ſhewing the ordure and the folly of it; or dolefull amorous fables which make of it a grave and ſerious ſtudy, and under the colour of honeſty and conſtancy of love, managed with an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and valourous carriage, hoodwinke and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch the readers minde with a pertinacious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion, making their braines runne wilde after chimera's and hollow imaginations, whereby ſome have runne mad. Indeed one cannot follow the fancies of romances without ſtraying from
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170100:125"/>right ſenſe; Neither is there any thing that makes the heart more worldly and carnal, and brings it further from God. I will be judged by all good ſoules that would betake themſelves to exerciſes of piety, when they were newly come from this kind of reading, Let them ſay in conſcience how farre eſtranged from God they found themſelves, and ill diſpoſed to every good worke.</p>
               <p>Sure it is not without reaſon that theſe writers ſet up falſe Gods, as being conſcious to themſelves that their writings are deviations from the true God, and aſhamed to name the God of truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their fables. Alſo becauſe with ſome of them, it is a prime piece of love-complement to make diſcontented lovers to wreake their anger upon the Deity, they will have this excuſe ready, that they are not blaſphemies againſt the true God, but againſt the gods of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Heſiod's</hi> making. But from theſe blaſphemous expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with falſe gods the readers learne to doe the like with the true, and to avenge themſelves upon him of all things that croſs their impetuous Paſſion. The ſame bookes ſet up the murtherous diſcipline of duells, as a gallantry of love, wherby lovers ſeale their affection to their miſtreſſes by the blood of their rivals or their owne.</p>
               <p>There are other matches of the wilde fire of carnal love which muſt be carefully avoyded, wanton diſcourſes, vicious companies, occaſions to doe evil, converſation with vaine malicious
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170100:125"/>women whoſe chiefe aime and taſke is to catch all the men that come in their way, not that they may keep them, but triumph over them, and caſt them away, and feed their owne vanity with the diſappointment of their ſuitors.</p>
               <p>Take heed of idlenes, it is Satans pillow, the counſellour of vice, and eſpecially the procurer of luſt. He that doeth nothing, thinkes on evill. Take heed of intemperance. Carnal love is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the matter, that whatſoever heateth the blood ſets the appetite on fire. Wherefore <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſets intemperance and incontinence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.8. <hi>They were as fed horſes in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every one neighed after his neighbours wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be two great remedies to take downe that heate, The one corporal which is mariage, inſtituted by God for that end, a holy and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate: When both the parties are good, and love one another, it is the greateſt ſweetenes of life. But whether a man be married or deſire to be, he muſt think on the vanity and ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the moſt pleaſant things of this world, the frailty of life, the certainty of death, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the hour; thence to inferre the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of St <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. <hi>But this I ſay, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the time is ſhort, It remaines that they that have wives be as they that have none,</hi> And ſo they that are woing muſt be as though they were not woing; that is they muſt impoſe moderation upon
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170100:126"/>their affections out of a wiſe apprehenſion of the vanity of the world and life, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>uſing this world as not abuſing it: for the faſhion of this world pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſeth away.</hi> Wherefore ſhould wee love with ſo much fervency that which wee cannot keepe when wee have got it, which we muſt leave, or which muſt leave us?</p>
               <p>The other duty is Spiritual, and it is that great and perpetual duty to Love God. Let that holy Paſſion alwayes rule in our hearts. Let us give to God his proper right, which he demandeth in his word, <hi>Pro.</hi> 25.26. <hi>My ſonne give me thy heart,</hi> and let us keep ſuch a watchfull guard about it that none ſteale it from him and us.</p>
               <p>Our love to a worthy Conſort being ſo mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated will become both lawfull &amp; pleaſant. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane condition hath nothing ſo delightfull as a reciprocal love: Yea of all things to which mans will doth contribute, it is the onely pleaſant thing. But, as navigable rivers enrich a country with commerce and plenty, when they keepe within their ſhores, but ruine it when they overflow with a violent landflood: Likewiſe, love while it keepes within limits, brings pleaſure and utility; when it exceeds them, it brings diſpleaſure and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Love that is not reciprocal will weare away in time. But a wiſe man will ſhorten the worke of time with reaſon, and will not obſtinately court a perſon that will not love him. For of what price
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170100:126"/>ſoever ſhe be, in our regard ſhe is of no price if ſhe be not for us. Wee muſt love our enemies, but wee muſt let them alone.</p>

               </head>
               <p>DEſire hath a neere kinred with love, for it is the motion of the appetite towards the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved object; This is the difference, that Love regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the preſent, Deſire aſpireth to the future.</p>
               <p>Some deſires are natural, ſome beſides nature. Natural deſires are good and eaſily ſatiſfied, as long as they keepe within their mounds, the firſt whereof is nature, then reaſon to rule nature, and piety to rule reaſon. But wee muſt take heed of miſtaking corrupted nature for pure. Pure nature is contented with little, but corrupted nature runs to exceſſe and embaſeth natural deſites with the allay of deſires beſides nature. It is natural for a man to deſire a woman, but it is beſides nature that he will have her ſo noble and ſo rich; that he increaſeth the deſired object with imagination, and kindleth his paſſion by difficulty. It is natural to deſire meate, drink, clothing, but it is beſides nature to deſire great feaſts, gay garments, and coſtly buildings.</p>
               <p>Reaſon, indeed, was given us to embelliſh and inrich nature, but Reaſon (if it be well taught) wil in all occaſions make uſe of nature to rule the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170100:127"/>deſire, and teach it, that beſides Nature there can be no neceſſity. Thus if your coach breake farre from the towne, inſtead of grieving and fretting, remember that Nature did not give you legs to ſit in a coach, and that it is not neceſſary for you to be carryed, as long as you can goe. If you be repulſed in the purſuite of an Office, remember that God made you not a Treaſurer or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of ſtate, but a man; and that to diſcharge the Office of man worthily, there is no need to be a Treaſurer or a Counſellour of State. Apply this to all the croſſes whereby your deſire is oppoſed, you ſhall finde in nature leſſons of reaſon and piety to rule it, and keep every where tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mind.</p>
               <p>But when a man makes no account of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of nature, and the Appetite takes licence to deſire as much as it can, the whole world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes too little for him. Nature hath bounds, but ambitious deſire hath none. If a luſtfull greedy tyrannicall man had as much power as deſire, he would violate the honeſty of all handſome women, and cruſh all the Empires of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, no mans life could ſcape his anger, God himſelfe ſhould not be ſafe in heaven. There are many ſuch men in the world; But the world may praiſe God that thoſe that have the vaſteſt deſire have the ſhorteſt power, and are kept by neceſſity within their limits of nature, even when their ambition moſt licentiouſly
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170100:127"/>tranſgreſſeth thoſe limits. An idle wiſher will lye raving in his bed, raiſing his greedy thoughts by many ſteps of imaginary conqueſts as high as the crown of <hi>China;</hi> and then ſeriouſly delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate whether he muſt make warre upon the <hi>Tartar</hi> or <hi>Japan;</hi> till he be ſuddenly called downe by his need from the height of his imperiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the low care of raiſing the wooll of his old thredbare cloak, and ſpinning the coorſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of his Sunday-dinner to ſave him from the ſhambles till the middle of the week. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.4. <hi>The ſoul of the ſluggard deſireth and hath nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Need doth not ſo much breed greedineſſe, as greedineſſe need; For need many times limiteth greedineſſe, and keepes the Appetite buſy about things neceſſary and neere hand; but whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is greedineſſe, there is need, even in the midſt of plenty. A great King invading his neighbours Province thereby confeſſeth himſelf needy, ſince he hath not enough of his owne. So long as a man doth not reckon what he hath, but what he would have, he never hath his recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for when he hath what he would he would have more, and all that he hath not is wanting to him; yea he wants even that which he hath, ſince he hath no ſatisfaction in it.</p>
               <p>This evill being wiſely managed may prove a remedy to itſelfe. For the inſatiableneſſe of mans deſire, helps us to theſe two thoughts. The one that all that the world affords is too
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170100:128"/>little for man, ſince it cannot ſatisfie his deſire. The other, that, among that corruption, an image of Gods infinity is ſhining; for mans deſire is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and nothing leſſe then infinity, which is God himſelfe, can ſatisfie him. Theſe thoughts ought to breed a reſolution in us, not to labour any more in vaine to fill our infinite deſire with things finite and inferiour unto us, but to raiſe it to the infinite good, as onely adequate to it, and the onely object where we may finde infinite ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. They, and they onely muſt expect ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of their deſire, that may ſay after <hi>Iſaiah, Iſaia.</hi> 26.8. <hi>In the way of thy judgements O Lord have we waited for thee; the deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us looke lower. For as long as we live in this houſe of fleſh, we have inferiour deſires for the uſe of the fleſh. Natural deſires are formed upon the information of the ſenſes; let us take good heed that upon their naturall information we forme not deſires beyond nature, but let us proportionate our deſires to the true and ſimple information of our ſenſes, not to the falſe tale of our imagination, ſwelled and beſotted by our greedineſſe. For the appetite and the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, helpe to cozen one onother. The turbulent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite ſtretcheth the imagination, and the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thus ſtretched preſents to the appetite greater images then the naturall.</p>
               <p>As in the clay upon the potters wheele if you
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170100:128"/>trace a ſmall circle it will ſtretch and grow wider as the wheele turnes and the clay ſpreads; likewiſe, a little image of the deſired object tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the common ſenſe in the imagination will grow as the imagination is dilated by the agitation of the deſire. Hence it is that the firſt impreſſion that the fancy receiveth of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beauty becomes in ſhort time the Idea of a more then humane perfection; and the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of a gawdy equipage and attendance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſed an agitation in the deſire, is ſoone imagined much greater then it is.</p>
               <p>But as in popular rumors which are growing as they runne, the firſt relator muſt be examined; likewiſe, to know the true ſtate of things, of which the imagination &amp; the appetite increaſing one another make ſo much noiſe and ſhew, we muſt examine the firſt relator, the outward ſenſe, to undeceive the overheated deſire by an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in cold blood. It is true, that the ſenſes perceiving nothing but the outward ſhew will make ſometimes a diſadvantageous report of the objects, but when they ſtirre not the deſire, but misinforme the imagination which doth the like to the judgement, whereby the object ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares evill, contemptible, or leſſe deſirable then it is indeed. Wherefore I would not truſt altogether the report of the ſenſes, but ſo examine them by reaſon that the ſoul be not ſeduced by the report imputed unto them. And indeed this
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170100:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>wil be no ſmall prevailing over the appetite, if we can bring it to deſire the things that truly belong to the ſenſes, by no other Idea then that of their ſimple report, ſo ſhall we limit the meerely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall deſires, according to Nature.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this might be thought an auſtere rule to keepe-in the deſire within the limits pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly naturall, ſomething muſt be yeelded to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and conveniency; Let the deſire be allowed to walk a little beyond theſe limits of Nature, but ſo led by the bridle of piety and reaſon, that it make no wild eſcape. Let us deſire things juſt, facile, neerehand, and inviting our hope, not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ourſelves about things remote and difficult.</p>
               <p>To ſtay our deſires, we muſt ſtay our thoughts before, and weane our minds of that falſe popular opinion, that thoughts are free; for it is the licentiouſneſſe of thoughts, that makes the deſire licentious. He that permitteth to himſelfe to think what he ſhould do with a hundred thouſand pounds a yeare, if he had them, will not be long ere he deſire to have ſo much. He that conſulteth what women he ſhould chooſe if it were lawfull and poſſible for him to keep as many as the <hi>Turke</hi> hath in his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently wiſh it poſſible though it were not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and this fancy will ſet his appetite on fire; Evill thoughts are next neighbours to evill deſires; there is but one ſtep betweene. He that will keep himſelfe from an infamous houſe muſt not take the lodging at the next dore.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:170100:129"/>
               <p>The beſt way to ſatiſfie the deſire of temporal things is to abridge it; A counſel comprehending theſe two, Not to depend of the future, and to be content with little for the preſent: Both are effects of an entire confidence in Gods goodnes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Of not depending upon the future I ſhall have ſeveral occaſions to ſpeake hereafter. To be contented with little is an unſpeakable treaſure. That way one may with much eaſe get plenty, which a covetous man cannot get by heapes of money ſcraped up with a greedy labour. He that deſires onely what he can have, obtaines eaſily what he will have; And he that deſires nothing but what pleaſeth God, hath obtained it already, All things ſmile on him becauſe he receives all things at the hand of God, whom he knowes to be good and wiſe. Little and much are all one to him, for both ſerve alike for contentment, as it pleaſeth God to extend a bleſſing upon it. Let us apply this to the three principal deſires that cauſe ſo much tumult and diſorder in the world, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, Ambition, and Voluptuouſnes.</p>

               <p>What I have ſayd of wealth and honours will perſuade any man of good ſenſe that they are not ſatisfying objects of a mans deſire, &amp; therefore not to be eagerly followed. It is our
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170100:130"/>Saviours conſequence, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Take heed and beware of covetouſnes, for mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of things which he poſſeſſeth:</hi> It is alſo St <hi>Johns</hi> conſequence, who forbids us to <hi>love the world and the things that are in it, becauſe the world paſſeth away;</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. Theſe are two powerfull reaſons to moderate the deſire of the things of this world, drawne from their nature: The one that they are not neceſſary, the other that they are tranſitory: And yet the covetous and ambitious ſeeke after them as if life conſiſted in them, or they were to endure for ever. Which they cannot thus deſire without turning their affection from the onely neceſſary and permanent thing which is God; <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.24. <hi>You cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> ſaith the Lord Ieſus. For as when a channel is cut for a river in a ground lower then her bed, all the water will fall where it finds a ſlope, and leaves her former channel dry. Likewiſe the deſire of man, whoſe true channel is the love of God, will turne the whole affection of the ſoule towards low earthly things when that ſlope deſcent of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſnes and ambition is made in the heart, and nothing is left for God.</p>
               <p>For it is improperly ſpoken that a man pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to great worldly honours is aſpiring too high; Rather he is ſtooping too low, for the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things of the world, yea and the whole world, are very much under the excellency of mans ſoule, and more yet below the dignity of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170100:130"/>Gods children. Who ſo then enſlaveth his ſoule of heavenly origine, and called to a divine honour unto temporal things, which in this low world cannot be but low, debaſeth his dignity moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily. And in all earthly things, high or low condition makes but little unequality, for ſtill it is earth; Hills and dales are alike, compared with their diſtance from Heaven.</p>
               <p>But what? as the Iſraelites quitted Gods ſervice to worſhip the golden calfe, the luſter of gold and honour will ſo dazell mens eyes and inflame their deſires that they tranſport unto things of this world that devout love which they owe unto God. Wherefore St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that <hi>covetouſnes is idolatrie. Col.</hi> 3. And it is no wonder, that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual objects prevaile more upon Nature then the ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>Yet covetous and ambitious deſires are not properly natural, but enormities of nature; for little proviſion ſerveth nature, whereas if all the waters of the ſea were potable gold, they would not quench the thirſt of covetouſnes. Nature is contented with a meane degree, but crownes heaped up to heaven would yet be too low for ambition. Greedines is an unthankfull Vice. It makes a man ſo thirſty after that he hath not, that he forgets what he hath, and thinks not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe advanced though he ſee a great many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, as long as he ſeeth yet ſome before him. He cannot enjoy that he hath, becauſe he hangs upon
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170100:131"/>that he hath not. Thus he is allwayes needy, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, unquiet, and ſpares his enemies the labour to find him a continual vexation. And whereas the proper uſe for which Deſire was given to man, is to ſupply his neceſsities, he makes uſe of his deſire to multiply his neceſsities.</p>
               <p>To that ſicknes theſe are the proper remedies. The firſt is to abridge our deſire, and be contented with little. To him that contenteth himſelfe with little, little is much: But to him that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with much, much is little.</p>
               <p>To abridge our deſire wee muſt beare downe our pride: That which makes a man think a great wealth to be too little for him, is his too great eſteeme of himſelfe. Whereas the humble and meeke, though they have but little, think they have more then they deſerve. Who ſo will calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compare what he deſerveth with that which God hath given him, ſhall find great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to humble himſelf, and praiſe God, and ſilence the murmuring of his greedines. Let us remember our beginning. Being borne naked a little milke and a few baby clouts ſerved us. Who would think that ſome yeares after, whole kingdomes could not ſatiſfie us? Yet our need ſince that time is not much increaſed. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Having food and raiment, wee may be therewith content.</hi> A little is ſufficient for neceſſary deſires, but for curious and ſuperfluous deſires the whole world is too little.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:170100:131"/>
               <p>Let us employ our greedy deſire to heale it ſelf, conſidering that this greedines for the wealth and honour of the world ſpoiles the enjoyment, and takes all content from it; for no man hath joy in theſe things but he that uſeth them as not uſing them: That greedines makes us ſeeke them with torment, poſſeſſe them with unquietnes, and loſe them with anguiſh. Yea many times greedines hindereth the acquiſition. Good fortune ſeldome yeelds to them that will raviſh her, but to the wiſe and moderate, who though they loſe no opportunity, woe her as little concerned in her, and are alwayes prepared for the repulſe.</p>
               <p>That wee ſpend no more about worldy fortune then it is worth, Put in one ſcale the ſplendour of honour and the plenty of wealth. Put in the other ſcale the labour to get them, the care and vexation to keepe them, the peril, the envy, the loſſe of time, the temptations offered to the conſcience, the ſtealing of a mans thoughts from God, and the danger of loſing heaven while wee goe about to get the earth; Then the incapacity of thoſe goods to ſatiſfie the deſire, their weakenes, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, and how one infortunate moment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the labour of many yeares, and then judge whether they be worth enflaming our deſire and enſlaving our affections.</p>
               <p>With the uncertainty of theſe poſſeſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the uncertainty of the poſſeſſours, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is frailer then mans life, nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170100:132"/>then his death, nothing more uncertaine then the hour. What need we lay up much trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſince we muſt loſe all? What need to get up very high to fall to the ground, and there to rot?</p>
               <p>And whereas the tranquillity and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man conſiſteth in the things that are within him, not in them that are about him, When he turnes his principall deſire and the whole bent of his mind to things that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, he goeth out of himſelfe, and ſubjecteth himſelfe to another; He begs of another that which none but God and himſelfe can give him: He makes his content to depend on that which is out of his power. A wiſe man will take heed of that, and will call-in his deſire to his owne breaſt, where he ſhall finde God if he ſeek him well, and in God his onely felicity. Let us be covetous to be rich in God, and ambitious to draw neare him.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſince our body and life are maintained with things that are without us we cannot but deſire them, as things which our neceſſity calls for. Beſides which, our condition and the courſe of the world makes many outward things to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary which in themſelves are not ſo. All theſe wee may deſire, ſo it bee with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fericur deſire, quietly ſubjected and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to that Maſter-deſire which muſt make a whole burnt-offering of the ſoul to God alone,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170100:132"/>that we may ſay to God with an entire and free heart, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8. <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, O Lord, and to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thee. With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, yea with my ſpirit within me will I ſeeke thee.</hi> Bleſſed we! that our ſpirit needs but to ſeeke within himſelfe, to finde the full ſatisfaction of his deſire, if he have the grace to deſire what he ought.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is eaſy to rule the Deſire of Volupty when we have once well apprehended the nature of it. The body hath the greateſt ſhare in the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which the world runnes after, we muſt not then for their ſakes ſubject our minde unto our body. The pleaſures of the body are ſhort, we muſt not then for a ſhort enjoyment enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a long deſire.</p>
               <p>They are light and of a faint taſte, we muſt not then have a great Deſire for a little Pleaſure. They promiſe much to the Deſire and performe little; Our deſire then being forewarned of this, will not lightly truſt their faire promiſes, and will looke more, to their capacity then their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation.</p>
               <p>Some pleaſures are altogether unlawfull. Of which therefore the deſire muſt be cut off alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And before we give any admiſſion to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170100:133"/>their flattery into our ſoules, we muſt take time to conſider the deſigne of him that ſets them on work, the Devill. By them he ſeekes to blindfold us that he may lead us into perdition, which he will be ſure to do if we entertaine his falſe careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for after blindfolding comes blindneſs in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, errour in the underſtanding, miſrule in the affections, beggery, infamy, hardneſſe of heart, a late remorſe, and eternall damnation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.16. <hi>By meanes of a whooriſh woman a man is brovght to a peece of bread, and the adultereſſe will hunt for the precious life. Prov.</hi> 7.26. <hi>She hath caſt downe many wounded, yea many ſtrong men have bin ſlaine by her. Her houſe is the way to Hell, going downe to the chambers of death.</hi> He that hath the grace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſo much before, will ſtep back when theſe inticements are offered unto him, and ſay, I will not buy a deſperate repentance ſo deare.</p>
               <p>Pleaſures in themſelves lawfull, become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull by accident, when they are deſired or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with exceſſe. Moderation is the ballance of juſtice and the nurſe of pleaſure. Without it, Deſire turnes into ſorrow, and Enjoyment into a ſeveriſh fit.</p>

For the pleaſures meerely corporall, the tedder muſt be the ſhorteſt of all; Yet in all humane delights, whether of the body or the mind, exceſſe is vicious and marreth the Pleaſure. <hi>Solomon</hi> found it in the nobleſt of humane delights. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>In much wiſedome</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is much griefe, and he that increaſeth knowledge increaſeth ſorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is one of the greateſt proofes of the vanity of mans condition that in all humane things where the pleaſure kindleth the deſire, the pleaſure is afterwards choaked by the very deſire: for either we ſeeke in them the pleaſure which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford, or we ſeek it otherwiſe then we ought, and even by ſeeking we loſe it. Which inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences are prevented or mitigated by moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the deſire and purſuite. For it will bring one of theſe two conveniences: Either we ſhall more certainly get what we would have; or, if we miſſe it, we ſhall not have the griefe to have loſt much labour about it.</p>
               <p>It were eaſy to draw a platforme upon paper of the moſt delightfull and compleat eſtate that humane deſire can aſpire unto in this world. And that eſtate ſhould be compounded with the three ſorts of life, contemplative, active, and fruitive.

               <p>But we have not the liberty to cut our coat out of the whole cloath. The skill of a good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer does not conſiſt in making a regular Fort upon a parchment or a ground choſen at will that hath all the natural advantages; but in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his art to the nature of the place unto which neceſsity engageth him, and overcomming by induſtry the incommodiouſneſſe of the ſeat: Likewiſe, a wiſemans work is not to frame to himſelfe poeticall felicities, but to take things as he finds them, and uſe them well; for in mans condition on earth there is no ſeat ſo ſtrong but is commanded, or if it be not now it will be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, as being ſeated upon an unſtable ſand, to day even, to morrow uneven, which no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſtrength or forecaſt can keep unmooved. The life of man being compounded of ſo many
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170100:134"/>different pieces, in which vertue and prudence have but little ſhare, why ſhould our deſire be ſo eagerly bent upon thoſe thungs which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the reach of our induſtry?</p>
               <p>Though you had attained once to that high point of human happines that you might contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate freely and with leaſure, doe uſefull and illuſtrious actions in ſociety, enjoy well-gotten wealth, an honorable degree, &amp; a cheereful heart, in a ſound body; how long can ye maintaine that ſtate? how many rubs ſhall you meete with in the faireſt way? A law-ſuit will make you goe up and downe and lay-by your contemplation: Envy and obloquy will croſſe and blaſt your beſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. A little ſicknes will take from you the taſte of all the pleaſures of life. I leave out great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. The torments of the ſtone &amp; the gowte, The ſudden floods of warre, The total ruines by falſe accuſations, things which may happen to all becauſe they happen to ſome; <hi>Accidere cuivis, quod cuiquam poteſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt deſirable things of the world being thus caſuall, and no delight conſtant, The wiſeſt and happieſt are they that ſeeke not their conſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the world, but ſtay their deſire upon the right object, which gives a ſincere and durable content, not ſubject to the toſſing of worldly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p>Let us have no fervent deſire but for thoſe things that are truly ours when wee have them
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170100:135"/>once, and which wee cannot loſe againſt our will, for in them conſiſteth true pleaſure. Thoſe things are, the true knowledge of God, his love, and union with him, as much as human nature is capable of in this life. For that union with God will breed in us a reſemblance of his vertues and a participation of his ſerenity, tranquillity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, facility and delectation in well doing. Theſe in which true delight lyeth, are alſo the true objects of our deſire. And here we muſt let the raines looſe to Paſſion. Since to poſſeſſe God is the infinite good and ſoveraine delight, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to deſire it, is to have no meaſure.</p>

               <p>Sadnes is the dolour of the ſoule, and the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe of the ſpirit. This ſeemes to be the moſt natural of all Paſſions, as hereditary to man from his firſt parents: For to our firſt mother God ſayd, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16 <hi>I will greatly multiplie thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows and thy conception; in ſorrow ſhall thou bring forth children.</hi> And to our firſt father, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>In ſorrow thou ſhal eate thy bread all the dayes of thy life.</hi> No wonder then that ſorrow is the inheritance of all their poſterity. That firſt couple dejected with the ſenſe of their ſinne and puniſhment, left a calamitous progenie. <hi>Job.</hi> 14.1 <hi>Man that is borne of a woman is of few dayes and full of trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:170100:135"/>
               <p>But although this be a natural Paſſion yet it is an enemie to Nature, for it makes the flowre and vigour of body and mind to wither, and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that goodly light of the underſtanding with a thicke miſt of melancholy.</p>
               <p>Some ſadnes is neceſſary in its end, as that which belongs to contrition, and the zeale of Gods glory. Some is neceſſary in its cauſe, as that which proceeds out of a ſharp bodily paine. There is a conſtrained ſadnes, when one is ſad out of good manners, and for faſhion ſake; Such is the mourning of heires, whoſe teares in funerals are part of the ceremony. Many times wee are ſad in good earneſt for being obliged to be ſad in ſhew. Then there is a wanton ſadnes which ſoft ſpirits love to entertaine, for weeping is alſo a point of curioſity and delicacy. No doubt but they find delight in it, for none ever doeth any thing of his owne accord, but for his owne content.</p>
               <p>Of Sadnes neceſſary in its end, I have ſpoken in the chapter of Repentance, and muſt againe in this, after I have given ſome counſels for repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the other ſorts of Sadnes. Thoſe are leſſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of counſel that are neceſſary in their cauſe; as when the ſenſes are pincht, for then no reaſon can perſwade them not to feele it, or hinder the mind to have a fellow feeling of the paines of the body. A Phyſician and a Surgeon will be fitter to abate that Sadnes then a Philoſopher, yet not then a Divine; for Divinity makes uſe of the very
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170100:136"/>paines of the body to raiſe up the ſoule of the patient to God; In deed the counſels of piety do not take away the paine, but they overcome it by the ſweet perſuaſions of Gods love to us.</p>
               <p>As for conſtrained and ceremonious Sadnes, wee muſt avoyd the exceſſe of it, and the defect alſo; chuſing rather gently to yeeld to cuſtome, then to be ſingular, and contradict all that wee approve not; keeping alwayes ſerenity within, in the midſt of theſe ceremonies, more grievous many times then the griefe that occaſions them.</p>
               <p>Wanton and delicate Sadnes, cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the allegation of heavy loſſes and great wrongs. For beſides that moſt part of the evils that men grieve for, are ſuch onely in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as a diſdaine, a reproach, a ſlaunder, the loſſe of ſome goods that did them nothing but harme; ſuppoſe that all the evills that wee grieve for, be evills indeed, it followes not that wee muſt grieve for them according to their grievouſneſſe, unleſſe it appeare that they may be mended by grieving. But never any dead man was raiſed from the dead by the teares that his widow ſhed upon his herſe. Never was a wrong repaired by the ſadnes of the wronged party. Adverſity will caſt downe poore ſpirited perſons, but raiſeth the ſpirits of the generous, and ſets their induſtrie on worke. The deepe ſorrow that ſeizeth upon a weake woman at her huſbands death makes her incapable to overcome the difficulties where he
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170100:136"/>leaves her: But a vertuous and wiſe widow hath no leaſure to weepe ſixe months cloſe priſoner in a darke chamber; rather ſhe comforteth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with following her buſineſſes.</p>
               <p>Alſo ſince time drieth up the moſt overflowing teares, and a ſecond wedding will take down the great mourning vaile; it will be providently done to moderate ſorrow betimes, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion may not be too eminent betweene Sadneſſe and Joy.</p>
               <p>To attaine that moderation we muſt take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that falſe excuſe of good nature, and love to the deceaſed perſon from immoderate mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for in effect it is no other love but the love of ourſelves that afflicts us, and not their loſſe, but ours.</p>
               <p>The true cauſes of immoderate ſorrow for the things of this world are, theſe two great errours, againſt which I am ſo often neceſſitated to give warning to my readers, as the ſprings of all the folly and miſery that is in the world. The one is the ignorance of the price of things; for he that will value money, honour, and credit according to their juſt price, and no more, will not be much afflicted if he loſe them or cannot get them. The other is, that we ſeeke out of ourſelves that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe and reſt which is no where to be gotten but within us, from God and ourſelves; and take thoſe things for ours which are none of ours, but depend of others, and thereupon runne
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170100:137"/>towards thoſe objects thus miſtaken with a blind impetuoſitie. Theſe are the true roots of Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which roots if we could pluck out of our breaſts, we ſhould never be ſad for any thing of the world.</p>
               <p>But it is very hard to pluck out that weed; for Sadneſſe is like a nettle, a malignant ſtinging weed ſpreading in the ſoyle where it hath once taken root, and ſucking all the vigour and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof. It makes a man murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and envy his neighbours, alwayes diſcontented, alwayes needy, ſuffering neither himſelfe nor others to be at reſt, odious to God and men and to his own ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The life of man being ſubject to occaſions of Sadneſſe, a wiſe man will not adde voluntary ſorrow to the neceſſary. And ſince <hi>by ſorrow of the heart the ſpirit is broken, Prov.</hi> 15.13. and <hi>a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſpirit dryeth up the bones, Prov.</hi> 17.22. ſo that Sadneſſe is the ruine both of body and mind; he will take ſo much care of the preſervation of both, of which he is accountable to God, as to baniſh from his breaſt with his utmoſt induſtrie that fretting conſumption.</p>
               <p>The beſt courſe for that is to exerciſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the love and contemplation of God, and faith in his promiſes. By theſe Sadneſſe is caſt out of the heart, and the ſoule is ſet in a pleaſant and ſerene frame. Next, this wiſedome muſt be learned of <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 5.17. <hi>It is good and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170100:137"/>comely for a man to eate and drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he takes under the Sunne all the dayes of his life which God giveth him, for that is his portion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſtinate Sadneſſe is unthankfull to God, for it drownes the benefits of God in an ungratefull oblivion, and takes away the taſte of them even while we enjoy them. And what a double miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is that for a man, to make himſelfe guilty by making himſelfe miſerable?</p>
               <p>For two things voluntary Sadneſſe is lawfull and uſefull, for the evill that we commit and the evill that others commit. Sadneſſe for our owne ſinnes is contrition. Sadneſſe for the ſinnes of others, is the zeale of Gods glory, both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable &amp; neceſſary. He that hath not a ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting of his owne ſins, muſt not hope for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and is ſo farre from finding it that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as ſeek it, for he that feeles not his ſickneſſe ſhall never look for the remedy. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come to me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>all ye that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> None are invited by the Goſpell but ſuch as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and are heavy loaden, none but they can finde reſt unto their ſonles. This comes to that I was ſaying lately, that we muſt be ſad for no evill but ſuch as can be mended by our Sadneſſe; Such is contrition for ſinne, for it helps to heal it, making us caſt ourſelves upon the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian the Lord Jeſus, whoſe merit is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170100:138"/>remedy to that great ſickneſſe. So, that Sadneſſe ends in Joy.</p>
               <p>We muſt grieve alſo for the ſins of others, for ſince we muſt love God above all things, we muſt be very ſenſible of the diſhonour offered unto his holy name. This made <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> to faſt and pray, and God ſhewed that their Sadneſſe was acceptable unto him.</p>
               <p>Sadneſſe then is of good uſe for theſe ends, ſo that we never ſeeke merit nor praiſe in it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring alwayes that Sadneſſe is evill in itſelf, &amp; good onely by accident. Sadneſſe of contrition and zeale is good as Purges and letting of blood, which are good onely becauſe there is ſome evill in the body; If all were well, there would be no need of them. As then we muſt take heed of too much purging and blood-letting, ſo we muſt of too much Sadneſſe either for contrition or zeale. The uſe of Sadneſſe in contrition is to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſerious, and to humble the ſpirit, that it may be capable and thirſty of the grace of God. The uſe of ſadneſſe in zeale is to ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with Gods intereſſes, and thereby beare witneſſe to God and our owne conſcience that we aknowledge our ſelves Gods children. For theſe ends it is not required at our hands to grieve without tearme and meaſure; For ſince the greatneſſe of Gods mercy is as high above our ſinnes, <hi>as Heaven is above Earth,</hi> (it is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> compariſon) our faith and joy in Gods mercy
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170100:138"/>muſt alſo be very much above our ſadneſſe for our ſins. And as God ſaith that our <hi>ſins are caſt into the ſea, Mich.</hi> 7.19. meaning the deep Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of his infinite mercy, likewiſe our ſorrow for our ſins muſt be drowned in the joy of his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereas alſo the blaſphemies and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods enemies, by his great wiſedome and power turne to his glory, our ſadneſſe for theſe oppoſitions muſt end in joy for that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power and ſoveraine glory of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father, to which the greateſt enmity of Satan and the world is ſubject and tributary, for by pulling againſt it they advance it.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of the ſubjects of Sadneſſe ſheweth more then any other, that man knoweth not himſelfe, there being nothing in which one is ſooner deceived. For many times we think ourſelves to be ſad for one thing, when we are ſad for another, miſtaking the pretence of our Sadneſſe for the cauſe. Many will impute their ſadneſſe to the ſenſe of their ſinnes, but the true cauſe is in their hypoconders ſwelled and tainted with black choller, oppreſſing the heart, and ſending up fuliginous vapours to the braines. No wonder that ſo often all the reaſons of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and the ſweeteſt comforts of godlineſſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erect a ſpirit beaten downe with ſadneſſe; the plaiſter is not layd to the ſore, for ſpiritnall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies purge neither the ſpleene nor the gall nor the braines, whoſe peccant humours breed all
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170100:139"/>thoſe doubts and feares whereby melancholy perſons ſo pertinaciouſly vexe themſelves and others.</p>
               <p>Indeed the reſolution of a ſerene and religious ſpirit will preſerve body and ſoul in a ſound and quiet ſtate: But that reſolution, which is excellent for prevention of the evill, will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome it when the humours of the body are generally dyed and infected with melancholy. Wherefore let us beware betimes that Sadneſſe ſettle not in our heart; for the indulgence ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to willfull Sadneſſe will in ſhort time ſowre all the humours of the body, and vitiate the whole maſſe of the blood, and the magazine of vital and animal ſpirits with melancholy: Then when the mind hath made the body melancholy, the body doth the like to the mind, and both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether contribute to make a man miſerable, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, miſchievous, ſavage, <hi>lycanthrope,</hi> and a heavy burden to himſelfe. When that habit of melancholy begins by the ſpirit, it is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; when it begins by the body, it is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>
               <p>To draw a man out of that deep gulfe, all ſpirituall and materiall helps are of ſmal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, unleſſe it pleaſe God himſelfe to fetch him out of it by ſtrong hand and a ſtretched out arme; And of him, before and after all remedies, we muſt begge the remedie againſt Sadneſſe: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy is the ſeat and faſtneſſe of the Devill,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170100:139"/>whence none but God alone can thruſt him out. Every time that Sadneſſe offers to deject our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, let us raiſe them againe preſently, chiding ourſelves as <hi>David</hi> did, who three times in the XLII, and XLIII Pſalmes tooke up his droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minde with this encouragement, <hi>Why art thou caſt downe, O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? Hope thou in God for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my countenance and my God.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of Joy.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>JOy is the acquieſcence of the Appetite in the acquiſition of a deſired good, or in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
               <p>Joy is more naturall then ſadneſs, for ſadneſs, though naturall, yet is an enemie to nature, but Joy is natures friend. Then, ſadneſſe is never without ſome degree of precedent conſtraint, and even they that are obſtinatly ſad, are ſorry to be ſo: But the heart applyeth it ſelfe freely to Joy; Sadneſſe is ill in itſelfe, and is good but by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but Joy is good in itſelfe, and is ill but by accident. Therefore conſidering both naturally, joy upon a falſe ground is preferable to ſadneſſe upon a true ground, for joy is a true good (at leaſt for a time) though the ground be falſe; but ſadneſſe is a true preſent evill, be the ground true or falſe.</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:170100:140"/>
               <p>But conſidering theſe paſſions morally, by the effects which they produce by accident, joy doth more harme in the world then ſadneſſe. For Joy naturally dilating the ſpirits brings the mind to a looſe carriage and takes the fence of warineſſe from about it; commonly joy is the mother of raſhneſſe. But Sadneſſe contracting the ſpirits, keeps the mind within the limits of ſoberneſſe, and brings it to ſerious thoughts. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.2. Hence it comes that <hi>it is better to go to the hoùſe of mourning then to the houſe of feaſting, for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. Eccleſ.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Sorrow is better then laughter, for by the ſadneſſe of the countenance the heart is made better. The heart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the heart of fooles is in the houſe of mirth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For of paſſions we may ſay as of men. Our friends flatter us, but our enemies tell us our faults. Joy, which is a friend of nature, doth flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it into errour and ſeduction; but ſadneſſe which is an enemy to nature, undeceiveth it and layeth open before a man his fault and his danger. The ſanguine temper which is moſt given to joy, is moſt ſubject to folly; But the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per where melancholy beares a moderate ſway is the fitteſt for prudence. But there are melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly as well as ſanguine fooles; And ſadneſſe gives evill counſel, as well as Joy: The ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of joy are more frequent and hot, and make
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170100:140"/>more noiſe. The ill counſels of ſadneſſe are leſſe frequent but they are darke &amp; miſchievous, and recompenſe their rarity with their malignity. The Italians call miſchievous and dangerous men <hi>huomini triſti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a fine conſideration how theſe two paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though contrary, yet are next neighbours; and how in Joy there is an ayre of complaint, and in ſadneſſe a tickling of pleaſure. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation is more naturall, then morall: It is more uſefull to learne, how Joy brings to ſadneſs than how it is mixt with it.</p>
               <p>It is an old expoſtulation that the caſe of men is miſerable to have their joyes attended with crime, and their pleaſures ending in a bitter farewell of remorſe, and ſometimes of deſpaire. But that is an unjuſt re-jecting of the fault of the perſons upon the things. The reaſon why our Joy is attended with crime and miſery is becauſe it miſtakes both the matter and the manner. We neither rejoyce for what we ſhould, nor how we ſhould.</p>
               <p>The firſt miſtake is in the object. For our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire aiming at Joy, applyes it ſelfe to falſe objects, and very often miſſeth them, or when it obtaines them, finds not in them what it ſought. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the appetite obſtinately bends itſelfe to finde in them more joy then their capacity can afford, and goeth about to ſtretch them beyond their ſtrength, it marres them, and loſeth the uſe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170100:141"/>of them; whence neceſſarily joy is turned into pettiſhnes and griefe.</p>
               <p>There is no ſincere joy, but that which ariſeth out of our inward wealth, which no outward oppoſition can take from us; But we make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon things without us, and are ſo unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as to require a ſolid permanent ground of joy, of things weake and tranſitory. Can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any thing but ſorrow from an ill grounded joy, ſince by placing our chiefe joy upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and deceitfull objects, we bereave our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the true and ſolid ground of joy which is our union with God? <hi>For my people hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted two evills</hi> (ſaith God by his Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi>) <hi>they have forſaken me the fountaine of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and hewed them out ciſternes, broken ciſternes that can hold no water. Jer.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>Then as we chooſe poore and weake ſubjects for our joy, we chooſe weak and evill waies to obtaine them; yea ſo farre, that many times the joy aimed at, is made more precious &amp; commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto us by the croſſeneſs and unluckineſſe of the way. Some hold that there can be no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt joy, and all lawfull pleaſures are taſtleſſe unto them becauſe they are lawfull; Theſe reape commonly a ſutable harveſt to their ſeed, Or if they get lawfull joyes by lawfull meanes, they make then unlawfull by their impetuoſity: And as women with child that uſe wicked meanes to be delivered before their time, loſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170100:141"/>their fruit; likewiſe, haſtineſſe brings but an abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive joy, and fervent deſire loſeth its fruit by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation.</p>
               <p>Here is then a very ill account of all human joyes. They that ſeeke them miſſe them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, or when they have gotten them they find no ſolid content in them. To come neere them, they goe farre from God. They corrupt them by evill wayes. They loſe them by raſhnes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. The worſt is, that the men loſe themſelves alſo, for while they ſeeke to glut themſelves with baſtard joyes, they caſt themſelves head long into endleſſe ſorrowes.</p>
               <p>What then? muſt wee ſeeke no Joy in any thing of this world? It is the opinion of ſome more grave then wiſe, not mine I profeſſe it. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I think that there is nothing in the world but affords matter of rejoycing to the wiſe Chriſtian. Two rules onely muſt be obſerved that wee may rejoyce as wee ought in God and his creatures, and all the accidents and occurrences of life. The one is, to hold it for certaine that there is no ſolid Joy in any thing diſpleaſing to God, for all ſuch joyes will bring great ſorrowes; Wherefore that wee may have Joy in all things, we muſt in all things ſeeke to pleaſe him by a filial love confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and obedience.</p>
               <p>The other rule, that wee may finde Joy in all things that are either of good or indifferent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is, to ſeeke it according to the kind and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170100:142"/>of every thing. To that end we muſt be carefull that the Joy that wee take in God be as little under him, as it is poſſible to us; and that the Joy that wee take in other things, be not above them. Since then God is all good, all perfect, all pleaſant, the onely worthy to be moſt highly praiſed and moſt entirely beloved, wee muſt alſo moſt exceedingly rejoyce that he is ours, and wee his, and that we are called to be one with him. As for other things let us judiciouſly examine what Joy they can give us, and loſe nothing of the content which their capacity can afford, looking for no more; For there is ſcarce any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the world, but proceeds from this cauſe to have expected of humane things a Joy beyond their nature.</p>
               <p>Now this is the great skill of a minde ſerene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious &amp; induſtrous for his own content, to know how to fetch joy out of all things; and whereas every thing hath two handles the one good &amp; the other evill, to take every thing dexterouſly by the right handle. A man that hath that skill will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his riches with a joy ſortable to their nature. And when he loſeth them, in ſtead of grieving that he ſhall have them no longer, he rejoyceth that he had them ſo long. If he loſe one of his hands, he rejoyceth that God preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him the other. If he loſe the health of his body, he praiſeth God for preſerving to him the health of his minde. If ſlandering tongues take
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170100:142"/>his good name from him, he rejoyceth that none can robbe him of the teſtimony of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If he be in the power of them that can kill his body, he rejoyceth that they cannot kill his ſoul. If he be condemned being innocent, his joy that he is innocent drownes his ſorrow that he is condemned.</p>
               <p>Love and Joy are the two paſſions that ſerve to glorifie God and praiſe him for his benefits. A thankfull admirer of Gods wiſedome and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath a cheerefull heart. All things give him joy; the beauty, variety, and excellency of Gods workes makes him ſay with <hi>David. Pſal.</hi> 92.4. <hi>Lord I will triumph in the workes of thy hands.</hi> He rejoyceth in hope to ſee better works, and the Maker himſelfe in whoſe ſight and preſence is fullnes of joy. If he look up to heaven, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth that he hath <hi>a building of God, a houſe not made with hands eternall in the heavens.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. If he look upon his body, he rejoyceth that <hi>in his fleſh he ſhall ſee God.</hi> If he looke upon his ſoul, he rejoyceth that there he beares the renewed image of God, and the earneſt of his eternall adoption. If he be poore, he rejoyceth in that conformity with the Lord Jeſus. If he ſee wealth in the houſe of his neighbours, he rejoyceth that they have the plenty &amp; ſplendor of it, &amp; that himſelfe hath not the cares and the temptations that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. As many miſeries as he ſeeth, ſo many arguments hath he to glorifie God, and rejoyce in
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170100:143"/>his goodneſſe, ſaying, Bleſſed be God that I am not maimed like that begging ſouldier, nor luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick like that bedlam, nor going in ſhackles like that fellon, nor a ſlave like that Counſellour of State.</p>
               <p>He will keepe account of Gods benefits, and conſidering, ſometimes his owne infirmities and naturall inclinations, ſometimes Gods wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the conduct of his life, he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with a thankfull joy, that God hath provided better for him then himſelfe could have wiſht; that his croſſes were neceſſary for him, and that if he had had a fairer way, he might have run headlong to ruine by his raſhneſſe.</p>
               <p>It were infinite to enumerate all the ſubjects of joy that God gives to his children; for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are numberleſs, his care continuall, his compaſſions new every morning, and the glory which he keepes for us eternall. Which way can we turne our eyes, and not finde the bounty of God viſible and ſenſible? Here then more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently then any where elſe our happineſs and our duty meet in one. It is a pleaſant task to worke our owne joy. Now it is the task of Gods children, in obedience to his expreſs command by his Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Rejoyce evermore.</hi> See how urgent he is to recommend that duty. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alway, and againe I ſay Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of Pride.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Contend not whether Pride muſt be called a Vice or a Paſſion. It is enough for me, that it is an affection too naturall unto man, the cauſe of many paſsions, and a great diſturber of inward tranquillity.</p>
               <p>Pride is a ſwelling of the ſoul, whoſe proper cauſes are, too good an opinion, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, too great a love of ones ſelfe: and whoſe moſt proper effects are, ambition of dignity, and greedineſſe of praiſe. Wherefore theſe two ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects cannot be overcome, unleſs we firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the cauſe which is preſumption, and a blinde immoderate love of a mans ſelfe.</p>
               <p>It is impoſsible for a man to be tranquill and ſafe, as long as he ſits upon a crazy and tottering bottome. Pride then making a man to ground himſelfe upon himſelfe, cannot but keepe him in a perpetuall unquietneſs and vacillation. <hi>How can ye beleeve</hi> (ſaith the Lord Jeſus to the Jewes) <hi>which receive honour one of another and ſeeke not the honour that comes from God onely? John</hi> 5.44. A text which taxeth Pride of two great evills, That is robbes God of his glory, and that it ſhakes the the foundation of faith; For a proud man ſeekes not the glory of God but his owne; and his owne glory hee doth not ſeeke of God, but will get
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170100:144"/>it of men by his owne merit. Alſo it turnes his heart away from his truſt in God to truſt in his owne ſelfe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.13. <hi>The wicked boaſteth of his hearts deſire,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> that is, he is confident that by his owne ſtrength he ſhall compaſs all his projects; And againe, <hi>The wicked through the pride of his heart will not ſeeke after God:</hi> for the one brings the other. He that truſteth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and is highly conceited of his owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is eaſily perſwaded that he hath no need of God.</p>
               <p>That diſpoſition of the mind is the high way to ruine. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Pride goeth before deſtruction and a haughty ſpirit before a fall.</hi> For God to whom only glory belongeth cannot but be very jealous of thoſe that wil ingroſs it to themſelves, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares open warre againſt them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.27. <hi>He will bring downe high lookes. Jam.</hi> 4.6. <hi>He reſiſteth the proud, but ſheweth grace unto the humble. Prov.</hi> 8.11. <hi>I hate pride and arrogancy,</hi> ſaith Soveraine wiſedome, which is God. As the winde hurts not the ſtalkes of herbs as long as they are ſupple and bowing, but breakes them when they are become dry and ſtiffe. The meeke and humble ſpirits that bow under Gods hand ſcape the ſtormes of his Judgements; But the hearts ſtiffe with pride are broken by them. They that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their weakneſſe, and ſeeke all their ſtrength in God, finde it, and may ſay with St. <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. <hi>When I am weake then I am
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170100:144"/>ſtrong.</hi> But ſuch as are high conceited of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and with their wiſedome will ſave the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Gods providence, provoke him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their counſels, and unravell the webbe of their crafty projects; <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.51. for <hi>he ſcattereth the proud in the imagination of their heart. Iſa.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Woe unto them that are wiſe in their owne eyes and prudent in their owne ſight.</hi> But bleſſed and wiſe are they that humble themſelves before God and relye upon his wiſedome. A proud man layeth himſelfe open to blowes by his preſumption, and like bubbles of ſoape water, the bigger he growes the weaker he is and ſwelles till he burſt.</p>
               <p>There is a deep wiſedome in this ſentence of <hi>Solomon; Prov.</hi> 29.23. <hi>A mans pride ſhall bring him low.</hi> For beſides the judgements of God which ſoone or late will ſinke a proud man, Pride it ſelf while it goeth about to raiſe a man, brings him extream low, for it makes him <hi>biſognoſo d'honor,</hi> needy of reſpect and praiſe: It makes him begge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dore to dore to get the approbation of ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, upon which he wholly depends, and without it thinks himſelfe undone. It makes him a ſlave to the opinion of others, thereby confuting the good opinion he hath of himſelfe, and making him tacitely confeſs, that he is indigent, empty, and hungry.</p>
               <p>Alſo a mans Pride brings him low, when it makes him put on the vizard of ceremonious and hypocriticall humility, and give to all men more
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170100:145"/>reſpect then belongs to them, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of all more reſpect then he deſerves. Of the ſame kinde are they, that deſpiſe themſelves that they may be honoured, and reject praiſe to get praiſe thereby, aſpiring in a carnall abuſive ſenſe to the benefit of Chriſts promiſe, that, <hi>He that ſhall humble himſelfe ſhall be exalted. Mat.</hi> 23.21. As in that humility there is pride, ſo in that pride there is a baſe minde.</p>
               <p>There are two correctives of pride, two ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary vertues, humility and generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet agreeing very well and helping one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>That prime Philoſopher of our age <hi>Monſicur des Cartes</hi> ſaith, that Generoſity as well as Pride conſiſteth <hi>onely</hi> in a good opinion of ones ſelfe, and that theſe paſſions herein onely differ, that this opinion is juſt in the one and unjuſt in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is judiciouſly ſpoken: yet their paſſions conſiſt not in that <hi>onely,</hi> for generoſity is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of courage ſtanding firme in itſelf, but Pride is a weakneſſe of ſpirit, begging greatneſſe from others. Generoſity lookes in contempt upon thoſe things where Pride lookes for glory; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though good things and good actions give matter for Pride, if you looke well to it, it is not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of good things that Pride ſtickes unto, but the circumſtance. It is not the goodneſſe of an action but the pride and luſter that goeth along with it which makes a man proud. But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170100:145"/>that Pride and generoſity are neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. He that hath a good and a juſt opinion of himſelfe, ſlips eaſily from a juſt to an overween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opinion; and a worme of pride will ſoone breed in a high and generous ſoul: Eſpecially when praiſes, the bellowes of Pride, blow on all ſides upon a man, it is a wonder if the wind get not into him.</p>
               <p>There is need then of humility, the other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective, to keep generoſity from degenerating into Pride. Humility is the free acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a mans owne weakneſſe and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, producing a voluntary depreſsing of himſelfe. This definition is proper onely to the humility of ſinners, not to the humility of the Lord Jeſus, who being all perfect hath nevertheleſſe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe more then any. Whence we learne, that perfection giveth yet more matter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility then imperfection, &amp; that the more a man is vertuous and like Chriſt, the more he muſt be humble. For there are two rootes of humility, the one the ſenſe of our owne indignity, the other an obligation to yeeld unto God al the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the good that is in us. Out of this laſt root onely, grew the humility of Jeſus Chriſt; But our humility holds by two roots, and more by the firſt then the laſt.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe of the good that is in ourſelves may ſtrengthen our courage with generoſity, to reject all that is vaine or evill and unworthy of us.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170100:146"/>Yet at the ſame time the ſenſe of our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt humble us before God, who is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and his eyes moſt pure and all-ſeeing; And before men alſo, becauſe appearing ſo unworthy before God, we muſt account ourſelves unworthy of any deference from his creatures, and becauſe if there be any good in us above others, it is the vertue of God not ours.</p>
               <p>Theſe two vertues well tempered together will ſet our minde in a right frame, and keepe it tranquill and content. But we muſt beginne by humility; for contrition, repentance, and faith itſelfe, belong to humility, which teacheth us to miſtruſt ourſelves and have our refuge to God, to finde pardon of our ſins in his mercy, and a ſupply of our weakeneſs in his vertue. Upon whom, when we ground ourſeves by a ſound faith, and by it are ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe bearing witneſſe to our ſpirits that we are Gods children, then a holy generoſity is bred in our hearts by the ſenſe of that high quality, which makes us looke with contempt, not onely upon the pollutions of the world but even upon its luſter, as things farre under us, and reject all the temptations to evill, bayted with pleaſure honour and profit, as unworthy of our degree; For is there any thing ſo much worth in the world that a thild of God ſhould diſpleaſe his heavenly Father to get it?</p>
               <p>Keeping that temper we ſhall walk alwayes
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170100:146"/>before God with feare and joy together, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men with charity and modeſty; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Minding not high things but condeſcending to</hi> men and <hi>things of low eſtate, not being wiſe in our owne conceits;</hi> for it is a point of generoſity for a man to know his weakeneſſe. One may have his ſpirit above in heaven and yet condeſcend to men and things of low eſtate. Yea the more our ſpirit is ſublimated by faith and heavenly hope, the more eaſily do we accommodate ourſelves with mediocrity in earthly things, according to St <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſoning. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are above where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God; Set your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on things above, not on things that are on the Earth.</hi> This is the true remedy againſt pride. Have we high worldly thoughts? Let us raiſe our thoughts higher yet; Let us ſet our thoughts and affections on things above, not on things on the Earth: Let us never think our ſelves mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed high enough, till we be where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God. When the glory of the world fills a mans thoughts, while it doth lift him up with pride, it brings him down by cupidity under thoſe things that are under him: But when the glory of God ruleth in our hearts, it brings us low with humility, and together raiſeth us up by faith and a holy generoſity, far above all humane things, even as high as the right hand of God with Chriſt, there to rejoyce
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170100:147"/>in his love and ſweetly repoſe our hearts upon his fatherly care.</p>
               <p>None ſhall attaine to that bleſſed ſtate of the ſoul, which is already a heaven upon earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he beate downe his pride; A vice, which makes a man incompatible with God, for it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to that which to God alone is due, which is glory; incompatible with his neighbours, for it perſwades him that all things are due to him; and that the honour and advancement beſtowed upon any but himſelfe, is ill beſtowed; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with himſelfe, for it tortureth a mans minde with envy, makes him ſecretly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure againſt God and men, and renders him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the grace of God, which is onely for the meeke; and of his kingdome, which is onely for the poore in ſpirit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p>Here this method muſt diligently be obſerved to rectifie our opinion firſt, that we may rule our Paſſion. To bring downe the tumour of Pride let us get a right opinion of ourſelves; How we are begotten like beaſts, borne in lamentation, lying a long time in our ordure, living in a ſickly fleſh, wilde and fooliſh in our thoughts, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our affections, vaine and wicked in our converſation; blind, wretched, and guilty before God, and after a few evill dayes returning to the ground of our ignoble principle. In the midſt of the gawdy luſter of the world; let us looke to our end, a winding ſheet, putrefaction, wormes,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170100:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>mourning of our heires for a little while, and then perpetuall oblivion. Let us beare theſe things in mind, and then be proud if we can.</p>
               <p>Many Paſſions have their origine from Pride, which muſt be called to our barre after their Mother.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of Obſtinacy.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OBſtinacy is a compound of pride and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. It is an overthrow of the right polity of the ſoule, where the will muſt conſult reaſon; but Obſtinacy makes reaſon to conſult the will, ſo that a man will do or maintaine a thing, not becauſe it is reaſonable, but becauſe he did it and maintained it before. Ignorance begins, which hoodwinks the underſtanding with errour: Then comes Pride, which pins that hood faſt about his eyes, pretending that it is a ſhame for a man to go from his opinion.</p>
               <p>By Obſtinacy a man comes to that deſperate caſe of the ſoul, which Philoſophy calls <hi>feritas,</hi> that is, a ſavage brutiſhneſſe incapable of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and diſcipline. For he muſt be either in god or beaſt that takes his inſtinct for his perpetual rule and ſets before him his preſent will and doing as an immutable patterne of that he muſt will and do for ever after.</p>
               <p>When Obſtinacy hath thus ſhut the dore
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170100:148"/>unto diſcipline and ſtopt a mans ear againſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, one of theſe two evills followeth, Either he is hardned in evill without remedy; Or if by chance he light on the right ſide, he ſpoiles it as farre as in him lyes; maintaining truth and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not becauſe it is ſo, but becauſe he will have it ſo.</p>
               <p>There is no greater enemy to Chriſtian wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then that ſtubborne diſpoſition. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man ſtands in direct oppoſition againſt God, challenging to himſelfe that which belongs to God alone, even to make his will a reaſon and a law. When the light of reaſon, or the word of God, or the manifeſt courſe of his providence, declares to us what the will of God is, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to ſet our will againſt it, out of a pretended conſtancy in our former opinion and inclination, what is it elſe but to make warre againſt God?</p>
               <p>As Obſtinacy is odious to God, ſo it is odious in ſociety. It makes a man troubleſome, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and the undoer of himſelfe; And of his Country alſo, if he be aſsiſted with power, and hath many perſons and buſineſſes depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Expect neither wiſedome nor faire dealing, nor ſerenity within, nor good actions abroad, where the will takes no counſell of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. There is no place left for amendment, when one thinkes himſelfe obliged never, to alter his minde.</p>
               <p>As Obſtinacy hardeneth opinions it doth the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170100:148"/>like to paſſions, to thoſe chiefely that have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy for their fewell, as ſadneſſe, hatred, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and love alſo, for of theſe growne once inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate many times a man can give no reaſon, but that he will continue as he hath begun.</p>
               <p>This vice is a baſtard imitation of Conſtancy, whoſe name it borrowes, but very injuriouſly: for conſtancy conſiſteth not in ſtedfaſtneſſe to a mans own will, but in a firme adhering to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. That which is good one time, perhaps will not be ſo another time. Righteouſneſſe indeed is alwayes one and the ſame, but variety of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and circumſtances makes it change faces. As the needle of the compaſſe that ſtands ſo fixt upon the North, not to be mooved from that point by the greateſt tempeſts, yet will in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant turne to the South when the ſhip is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Equinoctiall line, and to that contrary point will keep with the like ſtedfaſtneſſe ſo long as it is in that hemiſphere: Likewiſe, a wiſe and good man will be firme in his reſolutions, where his duty calls him; So becauſe his duty lyes not at all times the ſame way, his reſolutions alſo are not bent at all times the ſame way, but will turne with his duty. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> deſired ſincerely the preſervation of the Kingdome of <hi>Juda,</hi> &amp; the liberty of his Country; But after that <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> had taken the Oath of allegiance to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he adviſeth <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and his people, to yeeld <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to him.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:170100:149"/>
               <p>In vaine Obſtinacy aſpireth to the praiſe of a great and brave ſpirit, it is rather a womaniſh narrowſpirited weakeneſſe. It was the proper ſaying of a femall, <hi>Mene incoepto deſiſtere victam!</hi> Muſt I be overcome and deſiſt from my purpoſe! Great houſes have ſome roomes for winter, ſome for Summer, and ſeverall apartements for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Offices; But in ſmall cabines the kitchin and the bedchamber are all one, and the ſame ſtill in all ſeaſons: Even ſo great ſpirits have a ſpace for diverſity of counſels, according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of occurrences, and various conſtellations of times and buſineſſes which continually alter; but they are narrowbreaſted men that have but one reſolution and one courſe to carry them through all things and times. It is for a low and timorous ſpirit to be afraid to change faſhion, and think himſelfe loſt when he muſt travell by a way that he never went before, whereas great ſpirits are complying, facile, univerſall; and their knowledge of the world, makes them finde nothing new or ſtrange.</p>
               <p>Obſtinacy ſhould be overcome from the cradle. Even then a child ſhould be uſed to be contradicted, and as ſoone as the light of reaſon beginns to dawne in his young ſoul, he muſt be taught to ſubject his will unto reaſon. Growne men, hardned in that vice by ill breeding and the flattery of men and fortune, yet may be healed if they will remove the cauſes of the diſeaſe.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170100:149"/>Since then Obſtinacy is a compound of ignorance and pride, they muſt ſtrive againſt both; Good inſtruction will expell ignorance, and as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge growes, eſpecially that of God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Pride will decreaſe, and they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come docile and ſuſceptible of better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>And whereas Obſtinacy puts reaſon out of her ſeat, ſubjecting her to paſſion her naturall ſubject, they muſt endeavour to reſtore reaſon to her right place and authority, forbidding the will to determine before reaſon hath given her verdict; or to give a reſolution for a reaſon, for if the reſolution bee unreaſonable, one muſt go from it, the ſooner the better. It is unworthy of a man to have no reaſon but his will and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and being asked why he perſiſteth in this courſe, not to give his reaſon for anſwer but his Paſsion. Indeed obſtinate men will give ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons of their fixedneſſe in their opinion; but let them examine ſoberly and impartially, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their opinion be grounded upon thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or whether they alledge thoſe reaſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will be of that Opinion.</p>
               <p>While wee goe about weaning of our mind from obſtinacy, wee muſt take heed of falling into a contrary evill a thouſand times more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; which is, to betray truth and righteouſnes, to complie with the time. For wee muſt never bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance whether God or men muſt be obeyed. We
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170100:150"/>muſt not follow the multitude to do evill, though the world ſhould charge us with Obſtinacy. If our conſcience tell us, that wee deſerve not that charge, wee may reſt ſatiſfied; for wee are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God of our opinion, not of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that others have of us. It is Conſtancy not Obſtinacy to maintaine truth and good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, even to the laſt breath, deſpiſing publique oppoſition and private danger. I joine truth with good conſcience, becauſe if the queſtion be of a truth which may be left undefended without wronging a good conſcience, it would be a fooliſh Obſtinacy to ſwimme againſt a violent and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtreame to defend it. But if it be ſuch a truth as cannot be baulked without breaking faith with God and turning from a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wee muſt perſiſt in it, and reſiſt unto blood when wee are put to it. And better it is to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led opiniatre, then to be perfidious.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of Wrath.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I put Wrath among the retinue of Pride as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from it. To this one might oppoſe, that wrath is attributed to God in many texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; And that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>Be angry and ſinne not.</hi> And therefore that anger is not evil, and muſt be fathered upon a better Authour then Pride.</p>
               <p>Theſe objections will helpe us to know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170100:150"/>of wrath. It is certaine that there is no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion in God. But it is certaine alſo, that if anger were a vice it ſhould not be attributed unto God. The wrath of God is an indignation declared by effects ſhewing a reſenting of the offenſe offered unto his glory. As then, the anger of God proceeds from his glory, ſo the vicious anger of man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from his pride which is a baſtard glory.</p>
               <p>As for the other objection out of St <hi>Pauls</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Be angry and ſinne not,</hi> whence it followes that one may be angry and not ſinne, wee muſt diſtinguiſh betweene good and evill anger. The vicious anger comes out of pride, which is the evill glory of man, The good anger comes out of the glory of God; for the anger of Gods children when they heare his name blaſphemed, or ſee ſome horrible crime committed with the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of devotion and juſtice, is a ſenſe which they have of Gods glory, whoſe violation moveth them to jealouſy. It is good to be angry for ſuch occaſions; but becauſe anger is prone to runne into exceſſe, and to mingle particular animoſities with the intereſſe of Gods glory, the Apoſtle gives us a caveat to be angry and ſinne not.</p>
               <p>Then the vicious and the vertuous anger differ in the object chiefely; the vertuous regards the intereſſe of God, the vicious the intereſſe of a mans ſelfe: but both proceed from glory, and have their motions for the vindication of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For as religious anger hath for its motive the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170100:151"/>glory of God, the motive of vicious anger is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular glory, and the reſenting of private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, true or imagined. The proudeſt men are the moſt cholerick, for being great lovers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, &amp; valuing themſelves at a very high rate, they deeme the ſmalleſt offences againſt them, to be unpardonable crimes.</p>
               <p>Truly, no paſſion ſhewes more how neceſſary it is to know the nature and price of things, and of our ſelves above all things; for he that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends well how ſmall a thing he is, will not think the offenſes againſt him to be very great, and will not be much moved about them. The certaineſt triall to know how proficient we are in humility is to examine whether we have fewer and eaſier fits of choller then before.</p>
               <p>Ignorance of the price of things, and owning things that are none of ours, are the chiefe cauſes of diſorder in all Paſsions; but they are more evident in the Paſsion of anger, becauſe it is more violent, and puts forth thoſe errours to the outſide, which other Paſsions labour to hide.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe cauſes, Anger flowes out of more ſprings, as great and rapid rivers are fed by many ſources. Weakeneſs contributes much to it, for although a fit of anger looke like a ſally of vigour and courage, yet it is the effect of a ſoft ſpirit. Great and ſtrong ſpirits are patient, but weake and imbecill natures can ſuffer nothing, and like doors looſely hung, are eaſily gotten off
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170100:151"/>the hookes. The wind ſtirres leaves and ſmall branches, ſeldome the bodies of great trees. Light natures alſo are eaſily agitated with chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, ſolid minds hardly.</p>
               <p>All things that make a man tender and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, makes him alſo impatient and chollerick, as covetouſneſs, ambition, paſsionate love, eaſe, and flattery. The ſame effect is produced by the large licence given to the wandering of thoughts, curioſity, credulity, idleneſſe, love of play. And it is much to be wondered at, that anger is ſtirred by contrary cauſes, proſperity and adverſity, the replying of an adverſary and his ſilence, too much and too little buſineſſe, the glory to have done well and the ſhame to have done evill; ſo phantaſticall is that paſsion. There is nothing but will give occaſion of anger to a peeviſh and impatient ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of anger being paſt telling, our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will be better beſtowed to conſider the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, ſufficient to breed an horrour againſt that bluſtering paſsion, even in thoſe that are moſt tranſported by it, when they looke back upon that diſorder in cold blood. Fierce anger is dreadfull when it is aſsiſted with power. It is an impetuous ſtorme overthrowing all that lyeth in its way. How many times hath it razed Citties, turned Empires upſide downe, and extermined whole nations? One fit of anger of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> one of the beſt Emperours of the whole liſt, ſlew
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170100:152"/>many thouſands of men aſſembled in the <hi>amphi-Theater</hi> of <hi>Theſſalonica:</hi> How many then have bin maſſacred by the wrath of wicked Princes? And what ſlaughter ſhould there be in the world, if meane fellowes had as much power as wrath?</p>
               <p>What diſorders anger would worke abroad if it were backt with power, one may judge by the diſorder which it workes within a mans ſoul; for with the overflowing of the gall into the maſs of the blood, wrath at the ſame time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowes all the faculties of the mind, ſuffocates the reaſon, maddes the will, and ſets the appetite on fire; Which is to be ſeene in the inflammation of the face, the ſparkling eyes, the quick &amp; diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly motion of the limbs, the injurious words, the violent actions. Wrath turnes a man into a furious beaſt. If man be a little world, wrath is the tempeſt of it, which makes of the ſoul a ſtormy Sea, caſting up mire and foame, and breaking it ſelfe againſt rocks by a blind rage.</p>
               <p>In the heat of ſuch fits many get their death, or do ſuch things which they repent of at leaſure afterwards; for wrath brings forth an effect fortable to its cauſe; it comes out of weakeneſs and it weakens a man, there being nothing that diſarmes body and mind more, and expoſes a man more to injuries. Indeed, when anger is kept within mediocrity, it ſharpens valour, and awakes ſubtility and readineſſe of wit. But when
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170100:152"/>it is exceſsive, it makes the ſinewes to tremble, the tongue to ſtutter, and reaſon to loſe the free exerciſe of her faculties, ſo that a man out of too much will, cannot compaſſe what he wills: Latin Authors calling that weake violence <hi>ira impotens,</hi> impotent anger, have given it the right epithete, for it ſtrips a man of his power over his owne ſelfe and of ſtrength to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>In that tumultuous overthrow of the inward polity, what place remaines for piety, charity, meekneſſe, juſtice, equity, and all other vertues? for the ſerenity of the ſoul is the temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat where they grow, but the heat of choller parcheth them; they are not plants for that torrid Zone.</p>
               <p>I know that many times vertue is a pretence for choller. Angry men juſtifie their Paſsion by the right which they maintaine, thinking that they cannot mantaine it with vigour enough. Thus whereas other paſsions are corrupted by evill things, this it corrupted by good things; and then (to be even with them) it corrupteth thoſe good things: for there is no cauſe ſo good, but it is marred by impetuous choller. The great plea of anger is the injuſtice of others; But we muſt not repell one injuſtice by another. For although an angry man could keep himſelfe from offending his neighbour, he cannot excuſe his offence againſt God and himſelfe, by troubling
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170100:153"/>the ſerenity of his ſoul, which is expelling the image of God (for it is not reflected but in a calme ſoul) and bringing in ſtorme and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is the devills image. As when a hogſhead of wine is ſhaken, the dregs riſe to the top, and when the ſea is raging, the mire doth the like; a fit of raging choller doth thruſt up all the hidden ordure, which was ſettled before by the feare of God or men.</p>
               <p>The wrong done by others to piety and juſtice, is no juſt reaſon for our immoderate choler. For they have no need of ſuch an ill champion, which is rather a hinderance then a defenſe of their cauſe, and to maintaine them tranſgreſſeth againſt them. To defend ſuch reaſonable things as piety and juſtice, there is need of a free reaſon and a ſober ſenſe. And whether wee be incenſed with the injury done to them, or that which is done to us, wee muſt be ſo juſt to ourſelves as not to lay the puniſhment upon us for the faults of another, or make ourſelves miſerable becauſe our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are wicked.</p>
               <p>To that end wee muſt remember that in the violation of juſtice, God is more intereſſed then wee are, and knoweth how to puniſh it when he ſees it expedient. And if God will not puniſh it as yet, our will muſt not be more haſty then his; and it becomes us not to be impatient for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs, when himſelf is patient in the wrong done to his owne. Let the cauſe of our anger be never
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170100:153"/>ſo holy and juſt, the ſentence of St <hi>James</hi> is of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual truth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.20. <hi>The wrath of man worketh not the righteouſnes of God.</hi> If it be the cauſe of God that we defend, we muſt not uſe that good cauſe to bring forth evill effects; &amp; the evill that incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us can hardly be ſo grievous, as the loſſe of humanity and right reaſon, of which a man is deprived by exceſſive wrath; for <hi>Wrath is cruell, and anger is outragious. Prov.</hi> 27.4. <hi>It reſteth in the boſome of fooles,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 79.</p>
               <p>Our good opinion and love of ourſelves which (when all is ſayd) are the chiefe cauſes of anger, ought to be alſo the motives to abate or prevent it: for would any man that thinks well of himſelfe and loveth his owne good, make himſelfe vile &amp; brutiſh? Now this is done by letting the raines loſe to choler: whereas the way to deſerve the good opinion of ourſelves and others, is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ourſelves calme and generous, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the imperial power over ourſelves by any violence of paſſion. <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.32 <hi>He that is ſlow to anger is better then the mighty, and he that ruleth his ſpirit then he that takes a citty.</hi> I account not <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, a great Conquerour, ſince he was a ſlave to his anger. A man that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drew ſword and is maſter of himſelfe, is a greater Conquerour then he.</p>
               <p>That calme diſpoſition ſhall not want many provocations from thoſe with whom wee muſt of neceſſity live, ſervants eſpecially, and ſervile
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170100:154"/>ſoules, like unto cart horſes that will neither goe nor drive unleſſe they feel the whip, or be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a harsh angry tone. <hi>Seneca</hi> gives leave to the wiſeman to uſe ſuch varlets with the words and actions of anger, but not to be angry; A diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult taſke: It is to be feared that by counterfeiting anger, wee may become angry in good earneſt; and a man hath need of a ſound premunition of reaſon and conſtancy, before he come to uſe thoſe wayes; ſo eaſy it is to ſlip into anger when one hath cauſe for it, and is perſvaded that the faults of an idle ſervant cannot be mended without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; But anger is a remedy worſe then moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and no houſhold diſorder is worth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordering of our ſoules with paſsion. Better were it to be ill ſerved, or not ſerved at all, then to make our ſervants our Maſters, giving them power to diſpoſſeſſe us of the command of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whenſoever it will pleaſe them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us to anger. Yet a wiſeman may expreſſe indignation without anger, and an effectual vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; making others tremble, himſelfe ſtanding unmooved.</p>
               <p>Out of the anger of others wee may fetch three good uſes. The firſt is to learne to hate that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſsion and take heed of it, ſeeing how it is imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſervile together, ugly, unbecomming, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, hurtful to others and more to a mans ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond uſe is, to gather carefully the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170100:154"/>wholeſome warnings which an angry adverſary will give us: for he will be ſure to tell us all the evill he ſeeth in us, which ourſelves ſee not. A benefit not to be expected from our diſcreet friends.</p>
               <p>The third is the nobleſt uſe, To ſtudy the ſcience of diſcerning the ſpirits, conſidering with a judicious eye the ſeveral effects of every mans anger, for no paſsion diſcovereth ſo much the nature of perſons. It layeth a man ſtarke naked. Ifone be a contemner of God, as ſoone as he is angry he will be ſure to wreake his anger upon God with blaſphemies. If he have piety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, he will make them pleade for him, but lamely, as diſcompoſed by anger. If he be a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, he will inſult over the weake; and if he find reſiſtance, you ſhall ſee him threaten and tremble together, like baſe dogs then barking moſt when they runne away. If he be haughty, his anger will expreſſe it ſelfe in a malignant ſmile, and he will boaſt of his blood and valour.</p>
               <p>The occaſions of anger will better diſcover what a man is inclined unto; for every one will be ſooner moved for thoſe things where he is moſt intereſſed.</p>
               <p>As in anger, ſo in reconciliation, a diſcerning eye will reade a character of the ſeveral humours. The vaine and haughty man after he hath done wrong, ſtands upon reparation. The baſeminded man is threatened into ſubmiſsions after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170100:155"/>received. The covetous wretch will have reparation in money, and puts a rate upon every baſtinado. The conſcionable, meeke, and generous man is facile both in giving and receiving ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and eaſily pardons another mans anger, his owne with much adoe.</p>
               <p>From this let us reflect to the firſt uſe that wee muſt make of the anger of others. He that will mind well how wrath betrayes a man, and layeth open his infirmities; and how <hi>the man that hath no rule over his owne ſpirit, is like a citty that is broken downe and without walles,</hi> will fence himſelfe againſt that treacherous paſsion by Chriſtian meekenes and moderation, and will learne to be wiſe by his neighbours harme.</p>
               <p>To that meekenes we ſhal be much helped by the remembrance of our ſins, whereby we daily provoke God, and for which wee mought have bin caſt headlong into hell long agoe, but that he <hi>is ſlow to wrath and abundant in goodneſſe. Exod.</hi> 34.6. To expect that God our father be ſlow to wrath towards us, while we are hot to wrath againſt our brethren is the extremity of injuſtice and unreaſonableneſſe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, ſince we ſeeke here our tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which we have found every where inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably conjoyned with our duty, let us obſerve our Saviours precept, grounded upon his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learne of me that I am meeke and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall finde reſt unto your</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:170100:155"/>
                  <hi>ſoules.</hi> That way the Lord Jeſus the great Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of wiſedome found reſt unto his ſoul, the ſame way ſhall wee finde reſt to ours.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of Averſion, Hatred, and Revenge.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AVerſion is the firſt ſeed of Hatred, and hath a larger extent; for hatred regards onely perſons or actions, but many have Averſions for unreaſonable or inanimate things; wherefore thoſe Averſions are commonly unreaſonable, whether it be out of naturall antipathy, or out of fancy &amp; wantonneſſe. Perſons ſubject to thoſe Averſions have commonly more Paſſion then reaſon, and are ſuch as are made tender and are ſoft ſpirited by eaſe. Ladies have many antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyes, but among country wives and milkmayds you ſhall find but few that will ſwound at the ſight of a ſpider or a frog.</p>
               <p>A wiſe man muſt impartially examine thoſe Averſions, if he have any, whether they conſiſt in fancy or nature, and not flatter himſelſe in ſuch capricious weakeneſſes. He ſhall do much for his reſt and credit if he can weane himſelfe altogether from them. He that can command himſelfe to have no Averſion, of which he may not give a reaſon, will traine his paſsion that way, to have no unreaſonable Hatred againſt any perſon.</p>
               <p>Hatred is an indignation for an injury recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170100:156"/>or imagined, or for an ill opinion conceived of a perſon or action. This deſcription is common to it with anger. Herein they differ, that anger is ſudden and hath a ſhort courſe; but hatred is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated at leaſure, and is laſting: Alſo that ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeeks more a mans vindication then the harme of others, but hatred ſtudieth the harme of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</p>
               <p>Hatred, as anger, is a compound of pride and ſadneſſe. (I meane the vicious hatred and the moſt common.) It proceeds likewiſe out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ones ſelfe, and the price and nature of things. This Philoſophy we learne of St. <hi>John</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.11. <hi>He that hates his Brother is in darkneſſe, and knowes not whither he goes, becauſe that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath blinded his eyes;</hi> for ignorance is the darkneſſe of the ſoul. As then blind men are commonly teſty, the blindneſſe of ignorance will make men prone to hate their neighbours, and hatred afterwards increaſeth that blindneſſe. By the ſame ignorance whereby we love ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things without knowledge and reaſon, we hate alſo ſome perſons and things without reaſon; and many will chooſe rather to loſe a friend then a ſhilling.</p>
               <p>Hatred is naturally good, ſerving to make us avoyd things hurtfull, and it is morally good when we uſe it to oppoſe that which is contrary to the Soveraine good which is God. When we hate that which God hateth we cannot do amiſs,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170100:156"/>ſo that we be very certaine that God hates it; ſuch are the unjuſt habits and actions condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his word and by that law of nature writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in mans heart: But as for the perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have no declaration of Gods love and hatred to this or that man, we muſt love them all, and never feare to offend God by loving that which he hateth, for we cannot offend him by obeying his commandement. Now he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to love our neighbours as ourſelves. No doubt but we muſt love many perſons which God hateth, neither will it be time to hate them till we have heard the ſentence of Gods perſonall hatred pronounced againſt them.</p>
               <p>I ſay, Gods perſonal hatred, becauſe there is a hatred of iniquity in God againſt thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his glory; which obligeth us to hate them alſo with that hatred of iniquity, and to oppoſe them vigorouſly, as long as they oppoſe God. Of that hatred ſpake <hi>David</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.21. <hi>Do not I hate them O Lord that hate thee, and am not I grieved with them that riſe up againſt thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, I count them mine enemies.</hi> But wee muſt take heed leſt the hatred of iniquity, bring the hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perſons; and the perſons muſt not be afflicted more then needs, for the repreſſing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity: The more difficult it is to keep that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the more earneſtly ought we to endeavour to render all offices of charity and perſonall huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170100:157"/>to them whoſe party we juſtly ſeek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate; for to love our enemies and to overcome the evill with good, is the moſt ingenuous imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Godhead. It is his command, joyned with his example, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44. <hi>Love your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, bleſſe them that curſe you, do good to them which deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you, that you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, for he makes his Sun to riſe on the evill and on the good, and ſends raine on the juſt and on the unjuſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is need of a great meaſure of grace and wiſedome to obſerve theſe two precepts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.10. <hi>Ye that love the Lord hate evill,</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.39. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour like thy ſelfe,</hi> hating iniquity in the wicked, and loving their perſons, and both for Gods ſake.</p>
               <p>The chiefe uſe of hatred is, to be incited to good by the hatred of evill. For that end, it is not neceſſary that the greatneſſe of hatred equall the greatneſſe of the evill, and we are not obliged to hate evill things as much as they deſerve; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the great currant of our affection would runne into the channell of hatred, and leave the channell of love, dry. Now it is in loving the Soveraine good with all our ſtrength and with all our ſoul, that our duty and happineſſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, not in hating the evill with all our ſtrength, and with all our ſoul. The hatred of evill is not requiſite of it ſelfe, but by accident, as a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170100:157"/>of the love of good. If the hatred of vice perſwade us to vertue, we ſhall be more yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to it by the love of goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>Many effects of hatred are the ſame as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of anger; for there is no anger without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in ſome degree, if not to a perſon, at leaſt to an action. But there is ſome hatred without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when one forethinks in cold blood the wayes to deſtroy an adverſary.</p>
               <p>All the deſtructions of the world where the will of man is an agent are wrought immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by hatred. They have many remote cauſes anbition, covetouſneſſe, carnall love, emulation and all the violent paſsions; but they deſtroy not, but by accident, till ſome oppoſition hath driven them into hatred, which in the inward polity of the ſoul hath the ſame office as the hangman in a Citty, for it is the executioner and avenger of wrongs. Unto hatred all the cruelty of tyranny and malice muſt be imputed. And yet all the blood ſpilt, all the ruines and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive torments outwardly wrought by hatred, are nothing ſo grievous as the inward diſorder wrought by it in cruell and revengefull ſouls, and the ſeparation which it worketh between God and man. It is the finall and moſt grievous effect of hatred, that, by hating our neighbours we become Gods enemies. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20. <hi>If a man ſay I love God, and hates his brother, he is a lyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hatred is a bitter venome which being once
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170100:158"/>diffuſed &amp; ſoaked into the ſoul turnes a man into a hell-fury, contrary to all good, ready and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to all evil. But with all the paine that ſuch a man takes to doe harme to others he doth more harme to himſelfe then to any, conſuming his ſpirits with a continual malignant fever, &amp; ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing from his ſoul ſerenity, charity, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; vertues which are the ſoyle of other vertues, and the givers of reſt &amp; contentment to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>It is often ſeene that while a man is gnawing his heart with a fierce hatred, the perſon he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth is healthfull, merry, and quiet, as if impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations made him proſper. An ill grounded ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred drawes Gods bleſſing upon the party unjuſtly hated and perſecuted. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.18. It was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> hope <hi>Let them curſe, but bleſſe thou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hatred is conceived for one of thoſe two ends, Either to avenge ourſelves or to avenge injuſtice which is Gods cauſe.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt: Before wee think of revenging an injury, wee muſt examine whether wee have received or done the greater injury: for it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary that the offender is harder to be reconciled, that it may not be thought that he is in the wrong.</p>
               <p>Then we muſt calmely conſider, whether the revenge may not doe us more harme then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, though wee had nothing to doe but to breake our launces againſt a dead ſtock incapable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it. For beſides that there is no enemy ſo little but it is better to let him alone then to provoke
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170100:158"/>him; the harme that hatred doth within us can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be recompenſed by any ſweetneſs of revenge, though there were no other harme in hatred then to find delight in robbing God of that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to himſelfe: Now he challengeth revenge as his owne, excluſively to all others; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.30. <hi>Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompenſe ſaith the Lord.</hi> To become incapable of reſt, incapable of doing good, incapable of pleaſing God, are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evils to deterre us from harbouring that inhumane paſſion, enemy of men, of God, and of ourſelves. <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.17. <hi>The mercifull man doth good to his owne ſoul, but the cruel troubleth his owne fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a right godly and philoſophicall ſtudy to ſtrive againſt that tendernes, quick to pick offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſlow to take ſatiſfaction. And wee muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious to deviſe cauſes of patience. Are you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned being guilty? acknowledge Juſtice. Are you innocent? bow under authority. Are you newly offended; It is too ſoone to reſent it. Is the Sunne gone downe ſince? It is too late. Hath any wounded you? look to your cure, not to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Are you well againe? let not your mind be harder to heal then your body. Are you offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a friend? remember the friendſhip more then the offense. Are you offended by an enemy? Doe your endeavour that he be ſo no more; retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him good for evil. Is he too ſtrong for you? It is folly to contend with him. Is he too weake? It is a ſhame. Is he your ſuperiour? you muſt
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170100:159"/>yeeld to him: Is he your inferiour? you muſt ſpare him.</p>
               <p>And ſince Pride, of which none is altogether free, repreſents our enemies to us under a vile and unworthy notion; let us fetch ſome good out of that evill; Let contempt help patience to beare with their provocations, for if a dogge did bite us, wee would not bite him againe, nor kicke at a aſſe that kicks againſt us.</p>
               <p>Alſo when ſome body offends us, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that wee have offended ſome body. The fault that wee find in another, is in our owne boſome. It is too great a flattery of ſelfe love to looke to be excuſed, and excuſe none; Wee are evill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and live among perſons evill and infirme. All have need to put on a reſolution of mutual forbearance.</p>
               <p>Above all things wee muſt remember that wee are all guilty before God, and ſtand in need of mercy, and unleſſe wee forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt us, wee pray againſt ourſelves, and aſke our condemnation every time that wee ſay the Lords Prayer.</p>
               <p>The meditation of death will conduce much to lay downe hatred. To wiſh one dead is among the vulgar an expreſſion of the greateſt hatred. If then wee may be ſatiſfied with the death of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we may be ſure that all our enemies ſhal die; but wee muſt be ſure alſo, that they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of us the like ſatiſfaction. The worſt wee can
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170100:159"/>doe the one to the other, is to bring us to the end which Nature leads us unto. As while two little fiſhes are fighting for a flye, the Pyke comes, that devoures them both; while wee quarrell about ſmall things, death is coming, which will ſwallow him that is in the right and him that is in the wrong, the victor and the vanquiſhed. Looke upon the broyles of the age of our fathers; What is become of the long and opiniatre quarrel of the Leagve in which all Chriſtendome was involved? death hath decided it. It hath cooled the
<note place="margin">* <hi>Titles that the</hi> Leagvers <hi>aſſumed.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and the <hi>Zealous;</hi> It hath ſtopt the full careere of hatred aſsiſted with valournd power. It will do the like to the quarrels of our dayes. Let us not be ſo hot in our diſſenſions; Death will quench our heat within a few dayes, and ſend us to pleade our cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our great judge. It will goe ill with us if wee appeare in that judgement, before wee have made peace with our judge by a true repentance and faith, which without charity with our neighbours cannot ſubſiſt. Why ſhould our hatred be long, ſince our life is ſhort?</p>
               <p>The ſame conſideration will ſerve to temper the hatred of iniquity, which for the moſt part is a pretence whereby wee cozen ourſelves and others, to palliate perſonall hatred. If we take Gods cauſe ſincerely in hand, we muſt conforme ourſelves to his will and wiſedome, expecting
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170100:160"/>till he ſend his meſſenger, which is death, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tache the wicked before his judgement. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.8. <hi>Ceaſe from anger and forſake wrath, Fret not thy ſelfe in any wiſe to do evill, for evill doers ſhall be cut off;</hi> 10. <hi>Yet a little while and the wicked ſhall not be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we hate wickedneſſe, we may be ſure that God hates it more yet, and he will puniſh it; but in his owne time, to ſatisfie his juſtice not our faſhion. Certainly if we hated iniquity in good earneſt, we would hate it in ourſelves. Though our enemies be wicked, we muſt love them for Gods ſake: and, becauſe we alſo are ſubject to the like infirmities, we muſt love them for our ſakes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of Envy.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HEre is one more of the Daughters of Pride, and therefore a grandchild of Ignorance and Selfe love. She is much like Hatred her elder Siſter. In this they differ, that Hatred is bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the evill; and Envy, againſt the good. But to ſhew herſelfe deſcended from Ignorance, ſhe miſtakes the falſe goods for the true; For no man will envy the Chriſtian vertues of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, nor the riches of his minde, but the goods of fortune w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> often deſerve rather to be called evils. Let a man grow in learning &amp; holineſſe, let him be a Saint upon earth, let him have Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call raptures no man will envy him for it, but let
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170100:160"/>him once get favour at Court, let his degree and his rents be augmented, preſently the arrowes of envy will be ſhot at him on all ſides. Indeed great Oratours, great Warriours, and men emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in civill prudence are much envied by idle droanes; but if you looke to the ground of that envy, it is not the vertue and capacity of thoſe brave men that begets it, but the fame and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit which they get thereby. Think not that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan envieth God becauſe he is good &amp; wiſe, if he did he would endeavour to be ſo: He envieth God becauſe he is Almighty, and becauſe he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped by men and Angels, whereas himſelfe would have all power in heaven and earth, and every knee to bow unto him. It is not vertue but the reward of vertue, that moveth envy. If it were in an envious mans power to diſtribute all the wealth, ſpirituall and temporall which is among men, he would not diſpute to his enemies the poſſeſſion of all the vertues, but he would keepe to himſelfe all the rewards.</p>
               <p>This is the cauſe of that diſpoſition. When an envious man ſeeth others enjoy wealth, he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there will not be enough left for him. But as for Vertue, he is ſure that the plenty of it with others, will not hinder his owne poſſeſſion of the like; So he doth not envy it. For nothing moveth envy but ſuch things as have moved cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity before: Cupidity is for light &amp; glittering ſtuffe, and envy keepes pace with cupidity.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170100:161"/>Vertue is a ſubſtance too dark and ſolid for their turne. Learne we then to ſtore ourſelves with thoſe goods, which provoke no envy, and which we may poſſeſſe, no body being the poorer by our riches.</p>
               <p>Envy is a great enemy to tranquillity of the ſuol. <hi>It is the rottenneſs of the bones</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 14.30. which is a pregnant character of a paſsing malignant and corroding paſsion. It hath two unnaturall effects, The one that an envious man is afflicted with the proſperity of others, the other that he puniſheth himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The firſt effect is particular to Envy, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it doth not enter commons with any other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The envious man is ſick, becauſe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is well. He groweth leane, becauſe another growes fat; he thinkes that he loſeth all that another gets, and makes of his neighbours proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity his adverſity. He is directly oppoſite to Chriſtian ſympathy and the commandement of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Rejoyce with them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and weepe with them that weepe,</hi> for he is weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them that rejoyce, and rejoycing with them that weepe. Whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Charity is not envious,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. wee may invert the termes, and ſay that <hi>Enuy is not charitable:</hi> yea, of all vices it is moſt incompatible with charity. Envious men are the onely kind of men, to whom without forme of juſtice &amp; without breach of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity wee may doe harme, ſince to doe them harme
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170100:161"/>wee need but doe good to their neighbours.</p>
               <p>But it is needleſſe to doe harme to an envious man, or wiſh him more harme then he doth to himſelfe, vexing his mind and drying up his body by a continuall and juſt puniſhment. This is wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſt in the <hi>CXII Pſalme,</hi> where after the promiſe made to the juſt that <hi>his righteouſnes endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever, and his horne ſhall be exalted with honoùr,</hi> the text addeth. <hi>The wicked ſhall ſee it and be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he ſhall gnaſh with his teeth, the deſire of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall periſh.</hi> And it is very probable that in the outward darknes where there is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, that burning fire and that gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and never-dying worme is Envy, biting the damned to the quick, while they are thinking of the glory and felicity of God, and how the Saints whom they have deſpiſed &amp; oppreſt in the world are filled with joy and crowned with glory, while themſelves are infamous and miſerable. That compariſon is a maine article of their miſery,</p>
               <p>The envious man cannot ſuffer as much as he deſerveth, ſince he ſets himſelfe againſt God and all that God loveth, controuling His diſtribution of his goods. He that is grieved at the good he ſeeth, deſerveth never to have any good, &amp; it were pitty he ſhould have any, if he can get no good but by his neighbours harme.</p>
               <p>Beſides the cauſes of envy which I obſerved before, there are two more that are great contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butours to that wicked vice. The one is want of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170100:162"/>faith; for a man becomes envious becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not that God hath enough in his ſtore to doe good to him and others, or that God doth wiſely to give him ſuperiours or equals. Which unbelecfe makes him to murmure and fall out with God. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. <hi>His eye is evill, becauſe God is good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other cauſe is Idleneſs. It makes men envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but it makes them poore before; for when they are growne poore through idlenes they look upon the wealth of their neighbours with envy. <hi>The ſoul of the ſluggard deſireth and hath nothing</hi> and the thing he deſireth is his neighbours eſtate, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he lookes upon with an evill eye. Hence warres, robberies, and piracies. For while diligent men grow rich by their induſtry, idle and envious men ſtudy onely to have ſtrength on their ſide to rob the induſtrious, or at leaſt to put a ſtop to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
               <p>This ſearch of the cauſes of envy opens us the way to the remedies. Since all diſorder in the appetite begins by errour in the underſtanding, wee muſt before all things heale our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that errour and ignorance which occaſions envy, even that falſe opinion that the wealth and honour of the world make a man happy; whereas they are inſtruments of wickednes and miſery unto weake ſouls; and to the ſtrong, hinderances and ſeeds of care. They are the ropes wherewith Satan drawes men into perdition; For one that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170100:162"/>uſeth them well, a thouſand are corrupted and undone by them. And who would envy ſlaves and miſerable perſons?</p>
               <p>Then wee muſt beate downe pride and the exceſſive love of ourſelves, with the ſtudy of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility charity, and meekenes. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife or vaine glory, but in lowlines of mind let each eſteeme other better then themſelves. Looke not every man on his owne things, but every man alſo to the things of others, Phil.</hi> 2.3. If once wee can get an humble opinion of ourſelves, and a charitable opinion of our neighbours, wee ſhall not be vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with envy ſeeing their proſperity, for we ſhall think that they deſerve it better then we. In ſtead of an envious comparing of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours eſtates with ours, let us compare what we have received of God, with what wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of him, and that will quell our pride and envy.</p>
               <p>An eſpeciall care muſt be taken to cut our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhort, which is the next cauſe of envy. He that deſireth little ſhall envy no body; For ſo little as he needs, he would not ſtrip another to cloath himſelfe.</p>
               <p>If ſometimes the luſter of worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cements dazle our eyes and breed in us ſome motions of envy, let us conſider what thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements coſt them that have attained them, how much time, money, and labour they have ſpent, how many doors of great perſons they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170100:163"/>how many frownes from their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, how many juſtlings from their emulatours: Then, how many temptations, how many ſhifts were they put to, even to diſguiſing of truth and wreſting of juſtice. Let us think well whether we would have bought preferment at that rate, and that if we have it not, we did not ſpend for it what others did. We have not broken our ſleep with cares, we have not bin many yeares totte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring betweene feare and hope: We have given no thankes for affronts. We have not courted a porter and a groome. We have not purchaſed with gifts a Clarkes favour. We have not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole bent of our mind from the ſervice of God to the ſervice of the world. In a word if we have not the wares, we have not payd our money for it. And if we would not have ſpent ſo much about that advancement, we have no reaſon to envy them that have bought it ſo deare</p>
               <p>The chiefe remedy againſt that fretting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is, faith in the power goodneſſe and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, with an entire ſubmiſſion to his holy will. Why ſhould we afflict ourſelves for Gods gifts to others? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. <hi>The ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him.</hi> He hath enough to enrich us all. Let us not looke what he gives to others, but let us humbly aske him that which he knowes to bee fit for us, and thankfully receive what he giveth us, being
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170100:163"/>ſure that all that he gives is good becauſe it comes from his good hand. If we can truly ſay, with <hi>Davids</hi> faith, <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, Pſal.</hi> 16.5. how can we after that looke upon our neighbours portion with envy.</p>
               <p>It is alſo an antidote againſt envy to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; well imployed for idleneſſe makes a man to leave his buſines to looke upon his neighbours worke, and doing nothing controule them that do well.</p>
               <p>As for the envy which others beare to us, we have reaſon to rejoyce that our condition is ſuch as deſerves envy, at leaſt in the opinion of others: It is true we muſt not referre ourſelves to the opinion of others, but to our own ſelfe about the happineſſe or unhappineſſe of our condition; but becauſe we are not ſenſible as we ought of Gods benefits towards us, and many times complaine when we ſhould praiſe God, our neighbours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſerveth to awake our ſenſe of Gods mercies, and to move us to thankfullneſſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of Jealouſy.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>JEalouſy is much like Envy. In Greeke one word ſerveth for both. Yet are they of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature. For a man is envious of that he hath not, but he is Jealous of that he hath.</p>
               <p>Beſides they are of different extractions. Envy
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170100:164"/>is the daughter of Pride, for to pride the envious man oweth the opinion he hath to be more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the advantages conferred upon others; but Jealouſy is the offspring of a baſe mind that judgeth himſelfe unworthy of that which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth, and feareth that another be more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it.</p>
               <p>Jealouſy is a various and phantaſtical medley of love, diſtruſt, revenge, ſadneſſe, feare, and ſhame. But that compound is not laſting, for love ſoone turnes into hatred, feare and ſhame into fury, and diſtruſt into deſpaire. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith that <hi>jealouſy is the rage of a man. Prov.</hi> 6.34.</p>
               <p>The predominant paſſions in Jealouſy (for Jealouſy is many paſſions together) are, feare not to poſſeſſe alone what one loveth, and ſhame of what the world may ſay of it; this laſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tears amans ſoul with extream violence; ſo ſlaviſh is the voluntary ſubjection of weake ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits under the opinion of others.</p>
               <p>A wiſe man will keepe himſelfe from that ſharp yet imaginary evill, by a ſincere love to his party, for <hi>perfect love caſteth out feare.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. He that loveth his wife well will truſt her, and that truſt will make her faithfull, or nothing will. <hi>Fidelem ſi putaveris facies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that counſell of truſting his wife, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band muſt joyne a reſolution not to miſtruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For here one may lawfully put on a good opinion of himſelfe, the queſtion being onely to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170100:164"/>compare himſelfe with others about pleaſing a woman, which is obliged to ſtudy to pleaſe him; and cannot, without grievous crime and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an enormous diſproportion of merit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and others, beſtow upon them that love which is due to him. A husband betrayeth himſelfe and tempteth his wives weakeneſſe, when he diſcovereth a diſtruſt of himſelfe, and a feare that ſhe preferre other men before him. This ſheweth her the way to value them above her husband, and ſhe thinkes herſelfe juſtified ſo to do by her husbands judgement.</p>
               <p>He muſt learne alſo to be credulous for his owne content, and of hard beleefe in the cauſes of diſcontent. For here it is better to be deceived in evill then in good, and it is better alwayes not to ſearch an evill without remedy, then to finde it; eſpecially when by ſeeking it, we make it come. The diſhonour of cuckoldry conſiſting onely in opinion, it is healed alſo with opinion, and he that feeles it not, hath it not.</p>
               <p>This inconvenience is prevented by making choice of a vertuous wife, and uſing her well, for reſtraint and hard uſage doth but draw the evill; Alſo by keeping us free from defiling our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours bed; This will give us a great confidence that God will not ſuffer any to defile ours; Moſt jealous men are adulterers, fearing what they have deſerved.</p>
               <p>But when one hath made an ill choyce, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170100:165"/>kindneſs, nor juſtice, nor prudence, can keepe a light and ungratefull woman to her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; When the wrong is ſo manifeſt, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the husband not to know it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling would be imputed to inſenſibility or even to conſent; the right counſell for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour is, to be divorced from a wicked wife. But if one can neither marry againe, nor live without a woman, and feareth that he ſhall hardly be able to keep himſelfe from harlots; of all harlots let him make uſe of his owne. It is better yet to keepe a lawfull whore, then an unlawfull.</p>
               <p>As for counſels for the interiour, one muſt practiſe the grand remedy to remedileſſe evils, patience. God, in this as in other ſorrowes of life, will finde wayes of comfort &amp; reliefe for thoſe that truſt in him, even where there is no way: The good company of ſo many brave men that are in the ſame row, is a help to beare it. A wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will make no more ſtrange of it, then of wearing a hat <hi>a la mode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He muſt keepe faſt to that true Maxime, that he cannot be diſhonoured but by his owne faults, not by the faults of another. A vertuous mans honour hangs not upon a light womans behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. If it did, it ſhould lye very unſafe. No more doth it depend upon his neighbours opinion. Perſons of honour and judgement will never diſeſteeme an honeſt man for it. And as for the talk of the vulgar, honour and good fame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:170100:165"/>no more of it, then of the gabbling of geeſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of Hope.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have ſpoken in the firſt Book of the Chriſtian Vertue of Hope. Here I ſpeake of a naturall Paſsion. Yet it is certaine, that they differ onely in the degree of perfection and in the object. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall hope is wavering, Divine hope is fixt; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine hope regardeth eternall goods, Naturall hope lookes for naturall and civill goods; Yet the object of Divine hope is not denyed to the naturall, but when that paſsion is determined by grace unto ſupernatural goods, it becomes a vertue.</p>
               <p>Hope is a compound of courage, Deſire, and Joy; but hath more of the firſt and ſecond ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient then of the third. Alſo a graine of feare enters into the compoſition; for if there were none, it would not be hope but expectation; as on the other ſide there is a graine of Hope in feare, for if there were no Hope, it would not be feare but deſpaire.</p>
               <p>Hope hath this common with love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that it regards a good object, at leaſt in the intention. But Hope conſiders foure particular qualities in her object, That it is abſent, that it is future, that it is poſſible and likely, and that it
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:170100:166"/>is yet uncertaine, at leaſt in ſome regard; if not in the ſubſtance, at leaſt in the circumſtance; for even the certaineſt Hope of all, that of eternall goods grounded upon Gods immutable promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is nevertheleſſe uncertaine of the degree, the manner, and the time of the enjoyment ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for.</p>
               <p>Laying aſide that prime object of hope, it is hard to ſay, whether Hope doth more good or harme in the world; For on the one ſide it raiſeth the courage and animates good enterpriſes with vigour; On the other ſide it blinds the reaſon, which inſtead of good chooſeth a diſguiſed evill, or turnes good into evill, by raſhneſſe &amp; unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Hope ſets the mind on gadding and aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring higher then it can reach, all wayes diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the preſent and hanging upon the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And how deceitfull are the promiſes of Hope! Of ten, one comes not to effect. With hoping good and ſuffering evill, mans life paſſeth away.</p>
               <p>Yet muſt we acknowledge the obligation that men have to hope, for it makes them ſubſiſt, even while it deceives them. What makes <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's</hi> confined to the mines, there to eate and drinke? It is Hope. What makes gally ſlaves to ſing while they are rowing? It is Hope. And would ſo many perſons whoſe dayes are a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall torment conſent to maintaine their wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life, but that in a bottomleſſe gulfe of evills
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170100:166"/>they will obſtinate themſelves to hope well; and after all goods are flowne away, Hope ſtayeth behind. Hence it comes, that many unfortunate perſons will ſtirre up their induſtrie, awake their vertue, ſtrengthen themſelves in faith, and live to ſee better dayes.</p>
               <p>So to anſwere the queſtion whether Hope muſt be reckoned among the goods or among the evills, it may be ſaid that it is the evill of them that are at eaſe, and the good of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: For ſuch as have meanes and dignity have alſo many deſignes and chained hopes, which keepe them hanging in chaines, while cares and feares, like ravens, are tearing their hearts. Beſides, they that are inchanted with many worldly hopes, conceive chriſtian Hope but remiſſely.</p>
               <p>Whereas they that are in adverſity being not tickled with thoſe delicate hopes which a man dares not recommend unto God, will fixe upon juſt hopes, ſuggeſted by neceſsity. And if they have any godlineſſe in them, they will ſhew it in grounding thoſe juſt hopes upon Gods mercy and promiſes. The leſſe invitation they have to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves with worldly hopes, the more will they ſtrengthen themſelves with the hope of heavenly goods.</p>
               <p>In both the fortunes, a wiſe lover of his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity will not feed or ſwell his hope, but for one object, which is, The fullneſſe of his union
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170100:167"/>with God; For any thing elſe he will clip the ſoaring wings of that aſpiring paſsion, and will not let her flye too high nor too farre.</p>
               <p>In the appetite, as there is a predominant love and a predominant deſire, ſo there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Hope. When it is anchored upon the only good perfect and immutable object, it keeps the ſoul firme and tranquill. If it be moored upon quick-ſand (and ſuch are all the things of the world, in which there is no ſafe anchorage) it will be carried away by every winde and tide, and never keepe in a quiet ſtation.</p>
               <p>The vulgar thinkes it a wiſe and couragious part to be obſtinate to hope well. But a firme and unmooved hope, ought not to be conceived or reſolved upon, but for firme and unmoved goods, even thoſe onely that are the ſubject of the promiſes of the Goſpell. But for things about which wee have no divine and eſpeciall promiſe, the more one is obſtinate to hope well, the more likely is he to ſpeed ill, becauſe the obſtinacy of Hope puts the judgement out of his office and leave t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> no roome for Prudence. And the ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe is made more bitter by the preceding obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hope; Whereas to him that ſtands prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the worſt, nothing comes againſt Hope; And if good come, he taſts it better, for his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe hath exceeded his Hope.</p>
               <p>The way to be little diſappointed, is to hope little; and the way not to be diſappointed at all
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170100:167"/>is to confine our Hopes within us, as much as we can, and to the things above, which the true Chriſtian finds already within; depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no future things, but his perfect reunion with God. Whoſoever will proportion his hope to the nature of the objects, ſhall never entertaine great hopes for worldly matters. For there is a great imprudence in that diſproportion to have great hopes for ſmall things.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of Feare.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FEare is a feeling beforehand of an evill to come, yet uncertaine, as leaſt in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; And when the evill is come, Feare end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and turneth to ſorrow or deſpaire.</p>
               <p>Feare is one of the moſt ſimple and naturall Paſſions. It is found even in the moſt unperfect animals, for God hath put it in all for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The very Oyſters will ſhrink for Feare, when the knife doth but touch their ſhell.</p>
               <p>As there are two evills to which men are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, paine and ſinne; there are two feares anſwering theſe two evils, the feare of ſuffering and the feare of ſinning.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt none is altogether exempt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Spaniſh Scholler examined at <hi>Paris</hi> about his proficiency in Morall Philoſophy, and demanded what Feare was, covered his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170100:168"/>with this bravado, <hi>In noſtra patria neſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus quid ſit timor.</hi> In our Country (ſaid he) we know not what Feare is. But without feare, a man can have neither prudence nor valour, for he that feares not the blow guards it not, and is ſlaine without reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The principall uſe of Feare is to prevent or avoyd evill. But when the evill is unavoidable, and now at hand, then reſolution muſt repreſſe Feare: Although even at that time feare doth good ſervice, for the feare of loſing honour or life erecteth a mans courage. Valour in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat is as often out of feare, as out of magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and it is often hard to diſcerne which of theſe contrary cauſes puts valour into a man. The certaineſt marke of valour by feare is cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when he that hath diſarmed his adverſary in a duell kills him without mercy, and after a field wonne puts all to the ſword; for he ſheweth that he feareth his enemy, even when he is out of combat. But he that gives him his life ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he ſeares him no more alive then dead.</p>
               <p>The moſt valorous are not they that have no feare, for it is naturall to all men; but they, that know how to moderate it.</p>
               <p>A man cannot Feare too little, for no evill can be avoyded by feare, but may much better be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded by judgement.</p>
               <p>To feare things which neither ſtrength nor forecaſt can prevent is an anticipation of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170100:168"/>evill. It is a great folly to loſe our preſent reſt out of feare of future trouble, as though it were not time enough to be afflicted when affliction comes.</p>
               <p>But Feare doth more then to bring neere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote evills, it creates evill where there is none. And many evills which ſhall never come and are altogether impoſſible, acquire by feare a poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and a reall being. We laugh at an hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driaque that thinks himſelfe to be made of ſnow, and is afraid to melt at the Sunne, becauſe he feares that which cannot happen to him. But a rich man tormented with feare of falling into Poverty, is much more ridiculous: For which of the two is the greater fool, he that feares that which cannot happen, or he that makes it happen by fearing it? The hypocondriack cannot melt at the Sun by the feare he hath of it, but a covetous man by his feare of being poore, is poore in good earneſt; ſo poore, that he wanteth even that which he hath, for he loſeth the enjoyment of his wealth by his feare of loſing it.</p>
               <p>It may be truly ſaid that there is no vaine Feare, ſince all feares whether true or falſe are reall evils, and Feare itſelfe is one of the worſt evils. It makes a man more miſerable then a beaſt, which feeles no evill but the preſent, and feares it not but when the ſenſes give her warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the neere approach of it. But man by his feare preventeth and ſends for the evill, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170100:169"/>it by imagination very farre beyond his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; many times alſo forging evill to himſelfe where there is none, and turning good into evill, for it is ordinary with us to be afraid of that we ſhould deſire.</p>
               <p>For remedy to that diſeaſe we muſt learne our Saviours Philoſophy. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.34. <hi>To every day is ſufficient the affliction thereof.</hi> If the evill muſt come, we muſt expect it, not go fetch it. Let us not make ourſelves miſerable before the time. Let us take all the good time that God gives us. Perhaps the evill will come, but not yet. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will not come at all. There is no Feare ſo certaine, but it is more certaine yet, that we are as often deceived in our fears, as in our hopes. And this good we reape out of the inconſtancy of humane things, againſt which we ſo much murmure, that it turnes as ſoone towards good as towards evill. <hi>Habet etiam mala fortuna incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiam,</hi> or if it turne not to good, it turnes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil. The arrow ſhot againſt us with a ſmall declination of our body will miſs us, and hit our neighbours head. A little winde will turne a great ſtorme; A ſudden commotion in the State will create every where new intereſſes. He that held us by the throat will be ſuddenly ſet upon by another, &amp; will let us go to defend himſelf. If we ſee no way for us to ſcape, God ſeeth it. After we have reckoned all the evill that our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can do, we know not what God will do. In the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170100:169"/>creation he made the light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ever ſince he takes delight to fetch the comfort and advancement of thoſe whom he loveth, out of the things they feare. That which we feare may happen, but it will be for our good. Unto many the bed or the priſon hath bin a Sanctuary in an ill time. Unto many the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique calamity hath bin a ſhelter againſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Many times that which lookes grim a farre off, ſmiles upon us neere hand. And what is more common then to be promoted by thoſe things which we feared moſt? Exile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation condemne us often to a happy tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, taking us from the crowd and the tumult to ſet us at large and at reſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations ſerve to decline, not to overcome the evill. Wherefore there is need of ſtronger remedies. For that we may be healed of Feare it is not enough to ſay, Perhaps the evill will not come, or will not prove ſo terrible as it lookes. Say we rather, Suppoſe the evill muſt unavoydably come, I do imagine the worſt; Say it be poverty, cloſe priſon, torture, the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, the axe; All that, can take nothing from me that I may call mine; God and a good conſcience are mine onely true goods, which no power and no violence can take from me; All the reſt is not worth the feare of loſing: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Behold God is my ſalvation, I will truſt and not be afraid, for the Lord Jehovah is my ſtrength, and my ſong, he alſo is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Then the remedy to the ſhaking ague of feare conſiſteth in knowing theſe two things. The evill and the liberatour; The evill cannot be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great ſince it hath an end, No evill of this world but ends by death, Death it ſelfe is good ſince it ends evills; how much more when it begins eternall goods? to the right Chriſtian, death is not a matter of feare but of hope. Let us take away from the things we feare that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous vizard which imagination puts upon them, calmely looking into their nature, and getting familiarity with them by meditation. Let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is incident to humane condition ſeeme ſtrange or new to us. What happens to one may happen to any other. The ordinarieſt cauſe of feare is ſurpriſe. That we be not ſurpriſed we muſt think betimes upon all that may come, and ſtand prepared for all. So nothing ſhall ſeeme ſtrange when it comes.</p>
               <p>But the chiefe remedy againſt feare is to lift up our hearts to the great Liberatour that hath goods and evills in his hand, that ſends afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deliverances, that brings downe and brings up againe, that gives us ſtrength accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the burden which he layeth upon us, and multiplyeth his comforts with our afflictions. Being perſwaded that God is moſt wiſe and moſt good, and that all things work together for good unto them that love him, we will repreſſe our feare of the accidents of life and ſecond cauſes,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170100:170"/>ſaying, The will of the Lord be done; we are ſure that nothing but good can come to us, ſince nothing can come but from God.</p>
               <p>Whereſore inſtead of fearing to ſuffer evill we muſt feare to do it, which is the ſafeſt courſe to prevent ſuffering. He that commits ſin is more unfortunate then he that ſuffers paine, for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moveth Gods mercy but ſin moveth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. That man cannot but feare ſinne that beareth in mind that God hates it and markes it; There then we muſt feare, and the chiefe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that we muſt aske of God is, that he <hi>deliver us from every evill worke.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.18. As we feare ſufferings becauſe of themſelves, ſo muſt we feare evill workes, becauſe of the evill that is in them, beſides the ſufferings that attend them ſoone or late. This Feare of love and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence towards God, puts out all other Feares: He that feares God, needs not Feare any thing elſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of Confidence and Deſpaire.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OF theſe we need not ſay much, having ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en before of Hope and Feare, for confidence is the extremity of Hope, and Deſpaire is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Feare.</p>
               <p>Confidence, which otherwiſe may be called a firme expectation, is a certainty that we conceive of a future deſired good, or of the love and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170100:171"/>of a perſon, whereby the heart is filled with joy and love.</p>
               <p>Deſpaire is the certainty that the mind concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth of a future evill very odious, or of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or infidelity of a perſon, whereby the heart is ſeized and in a manner ſqueazed with ſorrow and hatred.</p>
               <p>Theſe Paſſions being ſo oppoſite yet ordinarily will paſſe the one into the other, I meane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence into Deſpaire; from Deſpaire to paſs to Confidence, it is rare. The ſureſt courſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd falling into Deſpaire for things of the world, is to put no great confidence in them: Moderate hopes being fruſtrated turne into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate feares and ſorrowes. But a great and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Confidence being diſappointed will fall headlong into extream and deſperate ſorrow, as they that tumble from a high precipice get a heavy fall.</p>
               <p>One ſubject onely is proper for mans entire Confidence which is God, all good, all mighty and all wiſe: Without him all things that men uſe to repoſe their confidence upon, are waves and quickſands. Men are mutable, and though they could give a good ſecurity for the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their will, they can give none for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their life. The goods of the earth faile our expectation, or come ſhort of our ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or ſlip from our poſſeſſion. They will leave us, or we them. No wonder if they that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170100:171"/>repoſe their full and whole confidence in them are ſeene ſo often to fall into deſpaire. Here then the true counſell for tranquillity is to truſt wholly upon none but God; on other things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their nature and capacity. They ſhall never deceive us if we require nothing of them above their nature.</p>
               <p>There is a kind of Deſpaire improperly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led which is no more but to give over hoping a thing which upon our ſecond and better thoughts we have found either inconvenient or impoſſible. That Deſpaire will rather bring reſt then trouble to the mind. Wiſemen are pliable and eaſy to be ſatisfyed with reaſon. It is wiſedome to deſpaire and deſiſt betimes from unlikely and unfeaſable deſignes.</p>
               <p>It is a true Deſpaire when one ſeeth himſelfe abſolutely diſappointed and excluded from the object of his chiefe love, deſire, &amp; hope, at which the ſoul is ſmitten with ſuch a ſorrow that ſhe hates all things, yea the very thing that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſo much, and herſelfe more; the ſmaller and unworthyer the object is, the more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is the deſpaire about it, but in recompenſe it is more curable; For then one is eaſily brought to conſider in cold blood that the thing was not worthy either of his affliction or affection. But when the object is great and worthy, the deſpaire is more guilty and leſſe curable, Wherefore the worſt Deſpaire of all is when one deſpaireth of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:170100:172"/>the grace of God ſo farre as to hate him, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be worſe then to hate the Soveraine good, onely worthy to be beloved with all the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Many diſtruſt the grace of God who are not therefore deſperate, though they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo to be. Let them aske of themſelves whether they hate God, and let them know that as long as a graine of Gods love remaines in them, there is together a graine of faith, though oppreſt and offuſcated by melancholy. For it is impoſſible that God ſhould be their enemy and their Soveraine evill, while they love him. To them this comfort is addreſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me, and thoſe that ſeeke me early ſhall find me.</hi> And this likewiſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> If then we love him we muſt be ſure that he loveth us, and we muſt fight againſt the temptations of deſpaire, ſaying with <hi>Job, Though God ſtay me yet will I truſt in him. Job.</hi> 13.15. and with <hi>Iſaiah. Iſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Loe this is our God we have waited for him and he will ſave us; This is the Lord, wee have waited for him we will be glad and rejoyce in his ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Confidence is good according to the goodneſſe of the ſubject that it repoſeth upon. Wherefore Confidence in God the only Soveraine good, perfect, ſolid, and immutable, is the beſt of all, and the onely that can give aſſurance and content to the ſoul. He that is bleſt with that confidence is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170100:172"/>halfe in Paradice already: He is firme, ſafe, meek, ſerene, and too ſtrong for all his enemies: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.12. God is to him <hi>a Sunne</hi> to give him light, heate, life, and plenty of all goods; and a <hi>ſhield</hi> to gard him and ſhelter him from all evills: <hi>ver.</hi> 13. He gives him <hi>grace</hi> in this life, and <hi>glory</hi> in the next. <hi>O Lord of hoſts, bleſſed is the man that truſteth in thee.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Of Pitty.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>PItty is a Paſſion compoſed of love and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, moved by the diſtreſs of another, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or ſeeming. And that ſympathie is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grounded upon falſe love, becauſe we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our ſelves obnoxious to the ſame ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and feare the like fortune.</p>
               <p>Pitty is oppoſite to Envy, for Envy is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure conceived at another mans good, but Pitty is a diſpleaſure conceived at another mans harme.</p>
               <p>The Paſſion of Pitty muſt be diſtinguiſhed from the vertue that beares the ſame name, for they are eaſily confounded. The Pitty of the vulgar, which is imputed to good Nature and Chriſtian charity, comes chiefely out of two cauſes. The one is an errour in judgement, whereby they reckon many things among the great goods, which are good but in a very low
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170100:173"/>degree, and likewiſe many things among evills which are not evill. Hence it is that thoſe are moſt pittied that dye, and the beſt men more then any, as though death were evill to ſuch men; and they that loſe their moneyes, which are called <hi>goods</hi> as though they were the onely good things; and they that loſe their lands which are called <hi>an eſtate,</hi> as though a mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and well being were eſtated in them.</p>
               <p>The other cauſe of the Paſsion of Pitty is a ſickly tenderneſſe of mind eaſy to be moved; wherefore women and children are more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to it; but the ſame tenderneſſe and ſoftneſs makes them equally inclinable to choller, yea to cruelty. The people that ſeeth the bleeding car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe of a man newly murthered is ſtricken with great pitty towards him, who is paſt all worldly ſorrowes, and with great hatred againſt the murderer, wiſhing that they might get him into their hands to teare him to peeces. But when the fellon is put into the hands of Juſtice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and brought to execution, then the heat of the peoples Paſsion is altogether for pitty to him, and that pitty begets wrath againſt the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner when he doth his office. So eaſily doth the paſsion of vulgar ſoules paſs from one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to another, from pitty to cruelty, from cruelty to pitty againe, and from compaſsion for one to hatred for another. But all theſe ſuddaine contrary motions proceed from one cauſe which
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170100:173"/>is the tenderneſſe and inſtability of weake ſoules whoſe reaſon is drowned in paſsion, and their paſsion is in perpetuall agitation.</p>
               <p>But the Vertue of Pitty, which is a limb of charity, is a firme reſolution to relieve our neighbour that ſtands in need of our help, and it hath more efficiency then tenderneſs. This is the Pitty of generous and religious ſpirits aſpiring to the imitation of God, who without feeling any perturbation for the calamities of men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth them out of his mercy.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Paſsion of pitty is for the moſt part cauſed by the ignorance of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and badneſs of things, he that is leſſe miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in them is alſo leſſe inclined to that paſsion, for he calls not that <hi>miſery</hi> which others call ſo. <hi>Nec doluit miſerans inopem, aut invidit habenti.</hi> Or if a wiſeman pitty one dejected by poverty, it will not be his poverty, but his dejected ſpirit that he will pitty. And ſo of him that is weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a ſlander; a wiſeman will pitty him, not becauſe he is ſlandered, but becauſe he weepes for it, for that weeping is a reall evill, though the cauſe which is ſlander be but an imaginary evill. He will labour to get ſuch a firme ſoul that neither the good nor the evill that he ſeeth in or about his neighbours, be able to worke any perturbation within him.</p>
               <p>The world being a great hoſpitall of miſery, where we ſee wellnigh as many miſerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170100:174"/>as we ſee men: if we were obliged to have a yearning compaſsion for all the miſerable we ſhould ſoone become more miſerable then any of them, and muſt bid for ever Adieu to the peace of the ſoul and contentment of mind. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to give power to our neighbours to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our counſell, our labour, and our purſe in their need; but to give them power over the firmeneſs of our ſoul to ſhake and enervate it at their pleaſure, it is too much. Let us depend of none, if it may be, but God and ourſelves. Let none other have the power, be it for good or evill, to turne the ſterne of our minde at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledged that Pitty, as weake as it is, hath more affinity with Vertue then any other Paſsion, and turnes into vertue ſooner then any. That way weake ſoules handled with dexterity are brought to meekeneſs and charity; and that way many <hi>Pagans</hi> have bin brought to the Chriſtian verity. We owe the great converſions to the ſufferings of Martyrs which moved the beholders to compaſsion, for that compaſsion made a breach into the heart, and gave entrance into the underſtanding to that good confeſsion which theſe holy men made in the midſt of the fires; for nothing is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive then Pitty, neither is there any fitter hold to draw and turne the ſoul.</p>
               <p>But ſuch compaſsionate ſoules may be as ſoone
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170100:174"/>drawne to evill as to good by that hold. Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men brought to the gallowes for ſedition, have from that pulpit ſowne the ſeed of mutiny into the minds of a compaſsionate multitude, and thoſe ſeeds like the teeth of <hi>Cadmus</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent have brought forth ſince a diſmall harveſt of inteſtine warre. If then any good is formed in our minds by compaſsion, we had need to lay a ſtedfaſter foundation under it; for the meere mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Pitty are but fits and ſtarts, and are not actions but ſhakings of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>A wiſe man will learne how to take hold of the ſpirits of men by Pitty, but together will take heed that others hold him not by the like handle, which therefore he will ſhorten, and leave no hold but reaſon for others to take him by.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>Of ſhamefacedneſſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SHamefacedneſſe is ſuch a compounded paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it may not be deſcribed in few words. It is a ſadneſs out of the ſenſe or apprehenſion of a diſhoneſt evill. It is a ſelfe condemnation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about matters of love and deſires which one would ſatisfie in ſecret. It is alſo a ſudden amazement out of a diffidence of ourſelves when we are ſurprized by ſome inopinate occurrence, where we feare that more will be expected of us then we can performe: And to give a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170100:175"/>character: It is a ſad reſſenting of ones owne infirmity with ſome inclination to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>It is a cowardly Paſsion, found onely in timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous natures, yet in the more tender age and ſexe it is pardonable, and uſefull too, ſo it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsive, for by good inſtruction it may be formed into a vertue, but weake, and ſutable to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the ſubject. Stronger ſpirits dyed with piety and wiſedome abſtaine not from evill out of Shamefacedneſs, but out of knowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. But becauſe ſtrong ſpirits have bin weake when they were under age, and the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have bin timorous, unleſſe they be altogether dull and beſtiall by nature, there is a time to frame them to vertue by ſhamefac'dneſſe, which may be called a neceſſary infirmity in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And it is not expedient to remove it too ſoone from young minds by Stoicall precepts, leaſt they wanting that naturall bridle of the appetite, and not being yet well trained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by reaſon, let themſelves looſe to evill.</p>
               <p>Children in whom no marke of Shamefaced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe appeares are perverſe and ill natured, and though they be merry ſparkes they ſhall never be good nor able men. Shamefaced children are towardly and diſciplinable. But in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not the nature of men very weake and poore, ſince their beſt naturall diſpoſitions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and that there is need of thoſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to bring them to ſome good?</p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:170100:175"/>
               <p>Some natures are timorous in all the ages of their life by their native temper, therefore more obnoxious to Shamefacedneſſe; theſe are leſſe capable of a great and heroicall vertue, which is a compound of righteouſneſſe meekeneſſe and magnanimity, but they are docible for a leſſe eminent vertue: and their inclination to ſhamefacedneſs is a pliable ſubject for good diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. That diſpoſition muſt be well managed, as the ſeed of modeſty, and in women, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of pudicity, their chiefe vertue. How powerfull Shamefacedneſſe is with that ſexe the knowne example of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Virgins ſhewes it.</p>
               <p>There is another kind of ſhame recommended in Scripture. That of <hi>Daniel, O Lord righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee but to us confuſion of face. Dan.</hi> 9.7. That of <hi>Ezra, O my God I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my face unto thee. Ezra</hi> 9.6. And of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent publican, that <hi>ſtood a farre off, and would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to heaven. Luk.</hi> 18.13. But that ſhame which is a godly contrition for ſinne committed, and feare to commit more, is proper to a ſpirit fixt and confirmed in the love and feare of God, and hath nothing common but the name with the paſsion of ſhame, which with all her utilities is but a weakeneſſe of minde and a childiſh perplexedneſſe.</p>
               <p>A wiſe and godly man muſt be aſhamed of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſin. The remembrance of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170100:176"/>preſence, juſtice, and holineſſe of God, and the ſenſe of our owne imperfection muſt keepe us in perpetuall reſpect and humility, which is that good ſhame of <hi>Daniel, Ezra,</hi> and the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Publican. But for our converſation with men, when we are come to mans age, let us weane ourſelves as much as we can from boyiſh Shamefacedneſſe, which dejecteth and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſpirit, and makes a man loſe the faireſt opportunities of doing good.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Book is but a reſult of the two precedent, for who ſo hath got a right Opinion of things, and learned how to governe his Paſsions, wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for vertue and tranquillity; theſe two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles being not onely the materials and the rules of the building, but the whole ſtructure. And the order is as eſſentiall, as the matter, for the underſtanding muſt be illuminated and ſatisfied about the right judgement of things, and know how farre they are worthy that our appetite ſhould ſtirre for them, before we undertake to inſtruct our appetite how to behave ourſelves with them.</p>
               <p>Out of the right opinion &amp; the well governed Paſsion ariſeth the true temper of Vertue; which
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:170100:177"/>is a calme ſtate of the Soul, firme, equall, magnanimous, meeke, religious and beneficiall to a mans ſelfe and to others. All the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is in our Vertue is a defect in one of theſe two, or in both. And who is not defective in them? Who hath not errour in his Opinions, and by conſequent unrulineſſe in his Paſsion? Wherefore our deſcriptions of perfect human Vertue are accidents without ſubſtance. But what? we muſt not ſet before us any leſſe pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne then perfection. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect even as your Father which is in heaven is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Schoole gives definitions and diviſions of the ſeverall morall Vertues, which is no more then is neceſſary. Yet to ſpeake properly there is but one, even that equal temper &amp; juſt proportion of all the faculties and motions of the ſoul which is <hi>Juſtice,</hi> producing the like juſt temper abroad in all the parts of converſation; for to be juſt is to do all the parts of a mans duty, towards God, towards himſelfe, and towards his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>Temperance and Fortitude are handled in the Schooles as vertues by themſelves, which is to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good purpoſe, for a more diſtinct expoſition; but in effect they are parts of juſtice, for Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the juſt proportion of the appetite; and Fortitude is the conſtancy and magnanimity of the will requiſite to keep one juſt. Neither is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:170100:177"/>a Vertue different from temperance; for whereas of thoſe two duties <hi>ſuſtine &amp; abſtine,</hi> to ſuſtaine and to abſtaine, the firſt which is reſiſting oppoſitions is aſcribed to fortitude, the other which is abſtaining from the inticements of ſinne is reſerved unto temperance, yet both belong equally to fortitude, ſeeing there is as much, if not more, ſtrength of mind requiſite to ſtand out againſt alluring temptations as to encounter vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oppoſitions.</p>
               <p>There are then two vertues in all, the one intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall which is Prudence, the other morall which is Juſtice. I have ſpoken of the firſt, and this whole treatiſe is but an exerciſe of it: And of the ſecond alſo, of which the moſt eſſentiall part is the feare of God and a good conſcience: that is truly the prime Juſtice. All human lawes, if they be good are dependances of it; if they be evill, they are deviations from it. Naturall equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſanctifyed by grace ruleth both publique and particular duties, and both the outward and the inward man, which is farre more then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and civill law can compaſs. In all policies of the world Juſtice hath diverſe faces. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Law (eſpecially in great and antient States) hath ſtatutes and caſes without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which inſtead of clearing juſtice confound it. All that legiſlative labour regards outward action and the publique peace: But piety and true Philoſophy rule the inward action, and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:170100:178"/>ſettle the peace of the ſoul with the right and primitive Juſtice. Beſides, human lawes are moſt buſy in forbidding evill, and for that end make uſe of feare, and the terrour of puniſhment; whereas the inward law of Vertue is moſt buſy in preſcribing good, and for that end makes uſe of the motive of love and reward. But whether we need the motives of feare or love, we have a Soveraine Court within our breaſt where the great Judge of the Univerſe is ſitting continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There his Law is written and layd in view, entering into the eyes of the underſtanding, which ſeeth it even when he winkes that he may not ſee it. And there a mans owne thoughts ſtand divided at the barre, ſome accuſing, ſome excuſing him, out of that law compared with the records of the memory. Of that Court St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſpeaking that the very Gentiles and heathen <hi>ſhew the worke of the law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſſe, and their thoughts the meane while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another. Rom.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>Before that Court (that is before God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and before us) we muſt labour to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared juſt, and more to be ſo indeed. There juſtice muſt be ſetled. There it muſt be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. It will be well done to know and obey the formes of juſtice which publique order hath ſet over us, but our maine taske muſt be to labour for an niward and habituall juſtice. Let us
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170100:178"/>obey cheerefully all good or indifferent human lawes, but before all and after all let us ſeek and pray for that law of the ſpirit of life, which may ſet a rule to all the unrulineſſe within us, and make righteouſneſſe and peace to kiſs each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our ſoules.</p>
               <p>The ordinary definition of juſtice, that <hi>it is a conſtant will to give to every one his owne,</hi> as it is commonly underſtood, regards onely the leaſt part of juſtice, which is the rule of duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man. But let us give it a fuller extent: for to give every one his owne we muſt pay all that is due, firſt to God, next to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then to our neighbours. Certainly the two former parts of juſtice are far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable then the third which is the onely cryed up, though ill obſerved, in the world; for a man may and doth often retire from the ſociety of men, but he can at no time retire from God and himſelfe; and though a man were alone in the world, yet ſhould he have with him the chiefe ſubjects to exerciſe the vertue of juſtice.</p>
               <p>We ſhall give God his owne by loving him with all our ſoul, and with all our ſtrength, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying his will carefully, and cheerefully praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for his love to us, and for his owne great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs with a thankfull and a joyfull heart, ſetting him continually before the eyes of our mind, as alwayes preſent, that we may walke unto all pleaſing before his pure and all
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170100:179"/>ſeeing eyes, &amp; ſtick faſt unto him by meditation, affection, and entire confidence. And whereas man is the bond and the naturall mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the materiall world and the ſpirituall; who alone muſt render for the whole Nature the due homage unto the great Creator; Juſtice calls upon us to do that right to God &amp; Nature, to knit Nature with God by our love, faith, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and praiſes.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo we ſhall give to ourſelves our due, for <hi>to draw neere unto God is our good, Pſal.</hi> 73.28. to ſeparate from him is our deſtruction. <hi>They that obſerve lying vanities forſake their owne mercy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jonas, Jo.</hi> 2.8. meaning that they forſake him of whoſe goodneſs their being and wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depends. This thought will renew the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent characters of the naturall notions of juſtice engraven upon the marble of our hearts, upon which the corruption of the world and our owne hath bred as it were a thick moſs, which hides theſe characters. But with the feare of God that moſs is rubbed off, and the law of God the originall juſtice written there with Gods finger appeares plaine and legible. Who ſo then will do right to himſelf and recover his primitive dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity muſt ſtudy to know, feare, and love God, perfect his union with him, and aſſociate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his Angels, by obeying his will and tending his praiſe. His ſaving eternall light is for us, Wiſedome, righteouſneſs, ſanctification,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:170100:179"/>and redemption are for us, for he gives them to us liberally in his Sonne; We do but right to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when we ſtudy that thoſe bleſſings which are for us may be ours. And to loſe ſuch ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable graces by our neglect, is, beſides ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs towards God, a crying injuſtice againſt ourſelves.</p>
               <p>A maine point of that juſtice which we owe to ourſelves is, to labour to make ourſelves poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of ourſelves, and maſters at home; ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed from all outward tyes, that our content de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of none but God and ourſelves: and that rule over ourſelves is attained by yeelding unto God the rule, ver us.</p>
               <p>To that end our firſt labour muſt be to traine well the Paſſion of love, which is the great wheele mooving all the other paſſions; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſubjects that we love, and as we love them well or ill, we are good or evill, happy or unhappy. To love what we ought and as we ought, is the whole duty and happineſſe of man.</p>
               <p>Next, our deſires and hopes muſt be cut ſhort, which is not cutting downe Nature, as greedy minds may think: It is cutting off our bonds, and getting our liberty. That way plenty, pleaſure, and joy, are bought at an eaſy rate, for very little will content a mind weaned of ſuperfluous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and he hath little or no matter left for ſorrow, feare, anger, hatred, and envy, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170100:180"/>of the ſoul. What is able to diſquiet that man that thinkes nothing to be his but God and a good conſcience, and poſſeſſeth the things of the world as not poſſeſſing them? But to quiet the murmure of love and deſire, which are que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous and unlimited paſſions, we muſt do them ſuch equall juſtice, that while we ſtop them one way we open them another; Being kept ſhort for the things of the world, let them have free ſcope towards heavenly things, to love God, and deſire his ſpirituall and permanent goods, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limit and meaſure.</p>
               <p>The great injuries are thoſe which a man doth to himſelfe, when to obey luſt, or anger, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, one makes himſelfe guilty and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; when for the love of the world, one lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the love of God; when out of miſerableneſſe the body is denyed his convenient allowance: When for things of no worth a man proſtitutes his health, his life, and his conſcience. When men will ſinne for company, caſt themſelves into ruinous courſes out of compleaſance, and damne themſelves out of gallantry. Who ſo will ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think what he oweth to himſelfe and what account of himſelfe he muſt give unto God, will endeavour to keepe the precious health of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the golden ſerenity of his conſcience; he will enjoy with ſimplicity that portion which God giveth him of the contentments of life, and above all things he will carefully keep his onely good, which is God.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:170100:180"/>
               <p>Juſtice being well adminiſtred within us will be practiſed abroad with facility and delight. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Render to all their dues, tribute to whom tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is due, cuſtome to whom cuſtom, feare to whom feare, honour to whom honour.</hi> Let the debtour be more haſty to pay then the creditour to receive.</p>
               <p>All the Law-bookes are but comments upon this precept of Juſtice to <hi>render to every one his owne.</hi> Yet they omit the moſt eſſentiall parts of it, the duties of charity, humanity, and grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Which being without the rules of civill lawes, have the more need to be learned and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ingenuous and religious ſoules. And we muſt beleeve, contrary to the vulgar opinion, that they are debts, and that doing good to them that ſtand in need of our helpe is not giving but reſtoring. Therefore the workes of mercy are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the <hi>CXII Pſalm</hi> as works of Juſtice, <hi>He hath diſperſed, he hath given to the poore, his righteouſneſſe endureth for ever.</hi> Let us then be perſwaded, that when we do all the good of which God giveth us the faculty and the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we do but juſtice. Let us pay due aſſiſtance to him whoſe need claimes it, counſell to him that is in perplexity, kindneſs to them that have ſhewed us kindneſſe, pardon to them that have offended us, good for evill to them that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute us, love to them that love us, ſupport to the weake, patience to the impatient, reverence to ſuperiours, affability to inferiours. All theſe
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:170100:181"/>are debts. Let us omit no duty to which we ſtand obliged by the lawes of civill ſociety; Yet that is too ſcant, let us omit no duty to which we have the invitations of piety and generoſity. All the good workes that we may do, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties. It is the large extent that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives to our duty. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Finally bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report, if there be any vertue, and if there be any praiſe, thinke on theſe things.</hi> And the fruit of that ſtudy in the following words is that which we ſeeke in this Book, the Peace of the Soul &amp; our union with God. <hi>Do theſe things and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> Truly peace quietneſs and aſſurance are the proper effects of righteouſneſs, &amp; are as naturall to it as the light to the Sunne. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.17. <hi>The worke of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) and <hi>the effect of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, quietneſſe and aſſurance for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſidering Juſtice as the ſolid ſtemme in which lyeth the ſubſtance of all vertues as her branches, I will not follow every bough of that that tree; Two Vertues onely I will ſtand upon as the preſerving qualities of that univerſall Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Theſe are, meekeneſs and magnanimity. They are the neceſſary diſpoſitions to frame a right vertue in the ſoul, and peace with it.</p>
               <p>Under meekeneſs I comprehend humility and docility, which are but diverſe aſpects of the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:170100:181"/>ſame face, that meeke and quiet ſpirit which <hi>is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. As, for great edifices there is need of deepe foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, likewiſe to edifie the ſoul and build vertue and peace in it, there is need of a profound humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; which being joyned with faith is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the ſtructure, and the perfecting alſo: for we muſt be humble that we may be vertuous, and the more we are vertuous the more we are humble.</p>
               <p>With that meekeneſs the word of God muſt be receaved, which is the doctrine of Vertue and ſalvation. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Receive with meekeneſſe the engrafted word which is able to ſave your ſoules,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James. Iſa.</hi> 61.9. <hi>God hath anointed his Sonne to preach good tidings unto the meeke: Pſal.</hi> 25.9. <hi>The meeke will he guide in judgement, and the meeke will he teach his way.</hi> A mind well-diſpoſed to Vertue and the peace of the Soul, will diſtruſt himſelfe as a ſhaking unſound foundation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his truſt wholly upon God. He will labour to heale himſelfe of all arrogant opinions and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate prejudices, being alwayes ready to receive better information and ſubmit himſelfe unto reaſon.</p>
               <p>It belongs to that meekeneſs to be free from the impetuoſity of the appetite, for that which St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith of the wrath of man, that it <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the righteouſneſſe of God. Jam.</hi> 1.21. may be ſaid of all other Paſſions; they are evill if they
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170100:182"/>be vehement; for in a ſpirit agitated with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſions juſtice cannot ſettle, that very ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency being an injuſtice, and a violation of that ſweete and equall oeconomy of the ſoul fit for juſtice and peace. Paſſion goeth by skips and jolts, but Reaſon keeps a ſmooth even pace; and that pace is fit to go on Juſtice's errand.</p>
               <p>To meekeneſſe magnanimity muſt be joyned. Meekeneſs makes reaſon docile and pliant in goodneſſe. Magnanimity makes her conſtant in it. Both are the framers and preſervers of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; meekeneſſe becauſe it humbleth us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and ſubjecteth us under his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; magnanimity, becauſe it raiſeth our minds above unrighteous ends and wayes, and makes us aſpire to that great honour to have our will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto Gods will, and become partakers of his Nature, which is Righteouſneſs itſelfe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of magnanimity to ſollicite us to holineſs. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.</hi> As nothing makes the mind more magnanimous, ſo nothing makes it more holy, then that doctrine which teacheth Gods children that all the world is too little for them; and that God alone, who adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them and calls them to the inheritance of his Kingdome, is worthy to poſſeſſe their whole heart. For would any that is ſo highly dignifyed
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170100:182"/>ſtoope ſo low as to ſubject his affection to the things of the earth? or would he be ſo ungrateful as to returne him diſobedience for ſo much love? Rather his high condition will fill him with high thoughts, and according to the Apoſtles exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will endeavour to <hi>walke worthy of God who hath called him to his Kingdome and glory:</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. O, could we apprehend the excellency of this high calling by a ſerious faith, with what contempt would we looke upon thoſe things that captivate the paſſions of men! How ſhould we laugh at that which others deſire or feare! We ſhould looke upon the actions of men as behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the earth, from heaven, ſeeing the clouds of cares and ſorrowes gathering farre under our feet, and tumultuous deſires buſling and raiſing ſtormes; where we ſhould have no other ſhare but compaſſion of thoſe that are toſſed by them: Neither temptation nor perſecution ſhould be capable to trouble our heavenly ſerenity. The falſe profit and pleaſure of ſin ſhould not tempt our deſire, but provoke our ſcorne and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as unworthy of men, and muchmore of Gods children, coheires of Chriſt in his eternall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, called to be Kings and Prieſts unto God and their Father.</p>
               <p>The ſame magnanimity will breed in us agod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ambition to imitate God our Father, keeping righteouſneſs in all things becauſe <hi>the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs; Pſal.</hi> 11.7. uſing chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170100:183"/>and liberality, giving and forgiving, becauſe the <hi>Lordis good, and his tender mercies are over all his workes. Pſal.</hi> 145.9. Doing good to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, becauſe God fills with his goods the mouthes that blaſpheme him; And, becauſe God gives alwayes and receiveth nothing, we muſt thinke it more happy and divine to give then to receive.</p>
               <p>From magnanimity reflect againe to meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let all that is done magnanimouſly be done meekely together, with ſimplicity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, without noyſe and oſtentation. Theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues going hand in hand, meekeneſſe and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, are the two ſupporters of Juſtice, and the teachers of all goodneſſe. A meeke and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous ſpirit is the fruitfull ſoyle of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. To expreſs them in other termes more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to the Church, They are humility and faith, which with the love of God, the true eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Juſtice, make up the greateſt perfection that a man is capable of upon earth, whereby the minde is ſanctifyed, ſweetened, and raiſed; and filled with goodneſſe, peace, contentment, and aſsurance.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the exerciſe of Vertue in Proſperity.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IF I treat not methodically and ſeverally of all Vertues, the title of this worke may excuſe
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170100:183"/>me; I ſeeke not here the definitions and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Vertues, but the uſe; And of all the uſes that which conduceth to the peace and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mind. Beſides, all that we have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and all that we have to ſay, is an exerciſe of vertue, which careth not much by what name ſhe is called, juſtice, fortitude, temperance, or what you will, if ſhe may have leave to do her effect, which is to maintaine the ſpirit every where in a vertuous tranquillity.</p>
               <p>Her principall worke is, ſo to informe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forme the minde, both for Proſperity and Adverſity, that it be neither corrupted by the one, nor dejected with the other. That worke is the reſult of our ſecond and third Book. Who ſo hath learned to have a right Opinion of the things that the world deſireth or feareth, and to rule his paſſion accordingly, is fenced againſt all inconveniencies of both fortunes. But becauſe it is a worke of the higheſt difficulty and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to make the right uſe of theſe two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conditions, and go through both with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and equall ſpirit, Let us conſider them with more care, and learne to behave ourſelves vertuouſly in both.</p>
               <p>Let us begin at Proſperity, as that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more vertue. Infants will greedily graſpe the bright blade of a new knife, and cut their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; The like is done by growne men, dazled by the gay ſhew of honour, wealth, &amp; pleaſure; they
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170100:184"/>lay hold on them eagerly, and hurt themſelves, for they take them the wrong way.</p>
               <p>We need not ſay that Proſperity is good in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; He that would ſay the contrary ſhould not be beleeved. Yea none would beleeve that ſuch a man beleeveth what he ſaith. But by the evill diſpoſition of thoſe into whoſe boſome proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty falls, it becomes evill, yea farre worſe then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. For one that is ruined and brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire by adverſity, ten are ſpoyled and undone by proſperity; becauſe adverſity makes a man to retire within himſelfe, and warnes him to arme his minde with prudence, piety, and reſolution. But proſperity relaxeth the mind, and by it weak braines are made weaker, imprudent, arrogant, and profane; acknowledging no vertue, and no God, but Fortune; Which they think to be ſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with their perſon and merit, as not to have the power to diſgrace them. Such is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that <hi>David</hi> gives of a man corrupted with proſperity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.5. <hi>His wayes</hi> are alwaies <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, thy judgements are farre above out of his ſight, As for his enemies he puffeth at them. He hath ſaid in his heart, I ſhall not be moved, for I ſhall never be in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</hi> It is an unhappy proſperity that makes men diſſolute, outragious, puft up with pride, blinded with ſelfe love, ſometimes heavy with a drowzy ſloath, ſometimes tranſported with an inſolent joy. The moſt dangerous and moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary abuſe of proſperity is the diverting of a
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170100:184"/>mans thoughts and love from God and a better life, to fixe them upon the world. Wherefore <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of men <hi>incloſed in their owne fat,</hi> calls them <hi>men of the world whoſe portion is in this life, Pſal.</hi> 17.14. intimating that they have no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the other life. Truly proſperity is a ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place; With moſt men it is a faire walk ending in a precipice. And the leaſt harme it doth is to enervate the mind; and dull the edge of induſtry.</p>
               <p>The abuſes of proſperity are divers, according to the different humours of men. Some of a jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and inconſiderate humour glut themſelves with proſperity; and become fierce and violent. Others of a darke and timorous conſtitution are oppreſt with wealth and honour as with heavy weights, dare not enjoy what they have, and live in an anxious care to loſe all. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>The abundance of the rich will not ſuffer them to ſleep.</hi> They ought to thank him that ſhould eaſe them of that heavy burden, their riches.</p>
               <p>Of the ſickneſſes that attend proſperity I have ſayd much, and of their remedy. It comes to this. To conſider maturely the worth of things, that we may not love them above their worth, or expect of them a ſatisfaction above their nature; not to anchor our confidence upon their uncertainty: not to love any or truſt in any with all our heart but God, the only perfect and permanent good; To uſe the world as not uſing it, and enjoy the things we love beſt in it as having the uſe of them
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:170100:185"/>not the poſſeſſion, aſpiring continually to a better inheritance. This is the way to get a ſincere taſte of all the good that worldly proſperity is capable to afford.</p>
               <p>Now there is need of a ſingular prudence to pick that good among all the evill &amp; all the traſh that worldly proſperity is made of, &amp; not to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuperfluity for neceſsity, and that which is good in effect from that which is good in opinion only. For that man whoſe curioſity hath turned ſuperfluous things in to neceſſary, and whom the tyranny of vice and cuſtom ſuffers not to delight in any thing but unlawfull, is made guilty and unfortunate by his proſperity.</p>
               <p>Alſo, to uſe proſperity wiſely, and get the true benefit of it, a man hath need to weane himſelfe from preſumption and ſelfe love. Whence comes it that ſo many ſpoyle their proſperity by laviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inſolency, others loſe the taſte of it by inſatiable greedineſſe of adding and increaſing? It is, becauſe they have ſuch a high eſteeme and love of themſelves that they think all the goods of the world to be too little for them, either to ſpend or to lay up: Whereas he that hath an humble opinion of himſelfe taſteth his proſperity with ſimplicity and thankfullneſſe, for he thinks that he hath much more then he deſerveth. He that cannot bring himſelf to that low conceit of his worth, ſhall never be contented, though God ſhould poure all the treaſures of the world into
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:170100:185"/>his lap, and though he were mounted to the top of the wheel, and had nailed it to the axeltree to keepe it from turning.</p>
               <p>Who ſo will enjoy true proſperity muſt keepe faſt to this Maxime, that no true good can be got by doing ill. So whereas vice and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inſinuate themſelves under the baites of pleaſure, honour, and profit, there is great need to make proviſion of faith and good conſcience as antidotes againſt the generall corruption. As carefully as we walke armed, and looke about us when we travell through forreſts infeſted with robbers, we ſhould walke armed with the feare and love of God among the enticements of worldly profit, honour and pleaſure, for Satan lyeth in ambuſh every where. But whereas rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers will lurke in hideous and ſavage places to do their feates, Satan doeth his in the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious places. It was not among briers and thornes that he ſet upon man yet innocent, he made uſe of <hi>a tree good for food, pleaſant to the eye, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to make one wiſe. Gen.</hi> 3.6. And he made uſe ever ſince of beauty, daintyes, and curioſity to deſtroy mankind: Converſing among theſe is <hi>walking upon ſnares; Job.</hi> 18.8. There is great neede of wiſedome and godlineſs to avoyd them, and of a mercifull aſſiſtance of God to get out when our foot is enſnared in any of them.</p>
               <p>To the pleaſures honours and plenty of the world, faith muſt oppoſe other ſweeter plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170100:186"/>more ſublime honours, and riches infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater, even the pleaſures for evermore at Gods right hand, the honour to be of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the plenty of his houſe. Theſe he hath promiſed and prepared to them that love him, not to thoſe that chooſe rather to fill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with unlawfull delight and unrighteous gaine than to walke before God unto all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, waiting for the fullfilling of his promiſes. <hi>David</hi> expected to <hi>ſee Gods face in righteouſneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 17.15. thereby ſuppoſing that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out righteouſneſſe hee could not ſee Gods face. St. <hi>Paul</hi> expected <hi>the Crowne of righteouſneſs;</hi> he muſt then be righteous before he have the Crowne, and he muſt <hi>fight the good fight and keepe the faith</hi> before he be crowned. Could the height of that felicity enter into our low underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, what it is to be filled with the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods face, and receive at his hand the Crowne of righteouſneſſe, hardly would we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the miſſing of that glory for all the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full delights and profits of iniquity.</p>
               <p>Without looking ſo farre as the recompences and paines of the life to come, even in this life a godly, temperate, and conſcionable life, is a thouſand times more deſirable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant then a riotous diſhoneſt life, and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gotten by oppreſſion. Even thoſe <hi>Pagans</hi> that lookt for no good after this life, and laughed at infernall torments as old wives tales, yet
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170100:186"/>could ſay, <hi>Nemo malus felix,</hi> No wicked man is happy; for unlawfull delight and gaine leave behind them a ſting of remorſe, yea many times ſin ſmothereth pleaſure at its birth; beſides the disfavour of God and men which commonly followes. We caſt our reckonings amiſſe if we make account to poſſeſſe a happy and a wicked proſperity; It cannot be happy if it be wicked, for it is vertue, it is innocence, it is the love of God and faith in his promiſes, it is juſtice and charity, that give the pleaſant reliſh and the very being of proſperity.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that the acquiſition of the delights and advantages of the world, be neither accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with ſin, nor followed with remorſe, yet they are weake and tranſitory; riches are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, honours are fetters, pleaſures are feveriſh, fame is a wind, friendſhips are ſeeds of cares and ſorrowes, and yet in all theſe we ſeeke a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and permanent content, who can wonder that we find it not? For I do not inſiſt yet upon the principall thing, that we ſhould fix our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires upon God alone; But I ſay now, that to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy humane proſperity we muſt proportion our deſire and expectation to the capacity and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſſe of humane things, and to the power we have to diſpoſe of them and keepe them: If we expect more, we are diſappointed, and loſe the true taſt of our proſperity.</p>
               <p>But there may be defect as well as exceſſe in
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170100:187"/>the deſire and enjoyment of worldly proſperity. For there are ſome whoſe wild devotion knead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a timorous and ſavage humour, is afraid of all temporall comforts, be they never ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, naturall, and innocent; ſeeking vertue and merit by miſuſing of themſelves, and ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the proſperity that God giveth them, with an unthankfull melancholy. It is more then God requires at their hands; but he will require an account at their hands how they have enjoyed their health and the fruits of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly indulgence, which he had given them to uſe with moderation, comfort, and thankſgiving. Either there is pride and hypocriſy in that fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall marring of their proſperity; or if they are in earneſt, their braines is crazed, oppreſt by the black vapours of their ſplene. Abſtinence is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and neceſſary to be joyned ſometimes with prayer, to ſubject the body to the ſpirit. But the ſpirit muſt not deale with the body his ſubject, as the worſt of Tyrants do with their people, whom they utterly ruine to keepe them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. That voluntary ſelfe depriving of the innocent conveniences of life, is reproaching God as being too blame for making nature plentifull and delightfull, and then placing man in the midſt of his goods, and giving him ſenſes to reliſh them, and reaſon to uſe them.</p>
               <p>But the contrary fault is more dangerous and more ordinary, to hunt after temporall goods
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:170100:187"/>with a raſh eagerneſſe, and when one hath them to loſe the benefit of them by laviſh intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or even to turne thoſe goods into evills by getting them by ill meanes, and uſing them to ill ends. If Proſperity marre us, it is but even with us, for we had marred it before.</p>
               <p>The true way to be content every where, and purchaſe proſperity at an eaſy rate, is to deſire little and be contented with little. Not he that hath moſt but he that deſireth leaſt, is the richeſt. The leſſe a man deſireth the leſſe he wanteth, and the more reſemblance he hath with God, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſireth nothing, and wants nothing. It is unjuſt for us to ſolicit the world to give us riches, while we have meanes at hand to enrich ourſelves without troubling the world, which is, To deſire nothing. Why ſhould I aske of another that which I can give to myſelfe?</p>
               <p>But when all is ſaid, deſire is naturall and will ſtretch itſelfe upon ſomething. Now God alone is able to fill it. He that hath fixed his love and deſire upon God, and is allready poſſeſt with him by faith, may after that eaſily put that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy to practiſe, To deſire nothing out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to aske nothing of the world. He may tell Fortune that he needs none of her gifts, for having God he hath all. But he that wants that poſſeſſion which onely gives true ſatisfaction to the ſoul, deceiveth the world and himſelfe when he braveth Fortune, and bids her to keepe her
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170100:188"/>gifts to herſelfe, ſaying that he asketh content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of none, being able to give it to himſelfe; that he carryeth all his goods along with him, that he is rich and free becauſe he is maſter at home. Truly if he that ſpeakes ſo, hath nothing but himſelfe, he is very weake and needy. Yea unleſſe he poſſeſſe God, he cannot poſſeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and in that reſolution to cut off his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires, wanting the ſatisfying object, he is like him that makes a reſolution not to come neere the fire though it freeze hard, and himſelfe be thin clad. Whereas he that will cut his deſires ſhort, being enricht with Gods grace, is like him that will not come neere the fire, becauſe he is clad with warme furres.</p>
               <p>To ſuch a man rich in God it becomes well to ſay, I will not beg wealth and comfort abroad ſince I may have it at home. Finding tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſufficiency within my breaſt, why ſhould I make my ſelfe unquiet and needy by a greedy and worldly deſire? I will ſweetly enjoy the temporall goods becauſe they are Gods gifts, and receive them at his good hand with thankfulneſs: I will alſo indeavour to increaſe them by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, if I may without fraud to others, and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of my ſelfe. But I will importune no man to give me, as long as I may obtaine of my ſelfe not to aske. I will ſpare to others the paine to deny me, and to my ſelfe the ſhame to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having ſuch a ſhort way at hand to ſatisfie
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170100:188"/>me, which is, To aske and deſire nothing. The leſs I court the world, the leſs power ſhall I give it over me. This Philoſophy is eaſy to him that can ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 16.6. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup, thou main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt my lot; The lines are fallen unto me in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant places, yea I have a goodly heritage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moderation of deſires makes proſperity ſweet: And that moderation is harder in proſperity; for misfortunes rather breed feare then deſire, but good ſucceſſes are bellowes that ſwell cupidity, and cupidity making us depend of the future takes from us the enjoyment of the preſent. For we enjoy not what we have, when we complaine that we have not enough, and reckon not what we have got but what we would get.</p>
               <p>And becauſe in Proſperity men will grow proud and forget what they are; The higher that God raiſeth our degree, the more let us humble ourſelves, and keepe our mindes within the limits of modeſty. If advancements ſmile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us let us thinke rather to tread ſurely then to make haſt, and to ſit ſafe then to riſe high. As they ſay of <hi>Xanthus</hi> that being in drink he laid a wager that he would drink the whole Sea; they that are drunk with proſperity are prone to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake more then they are able to performe. The Apoſtles precept hath need to be preſt upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>that no man think of himſelfe more highly then he ought to thinke, but think ſoberly;</hi>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:170100:189"/>When we ſtand on a high tower our ſtature is never the higher then when we walke on the ground, but our braines is many times the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as being dizzy with the height. So, dignity and high proſperity doth not increaſe a mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity by raiſing his place, but rather makes him wilde and giddy. Whereas then proſperity makes men over-confident, it ought to make them more cautious, fearing leaſt ſome of the windineſs of the place where they ſtand get into their head: Let them ſtudy to know themſelves and the world, that they may truſt neither, as things beyond the verge of their power, and whoſe ſubſiſtence dependeth not of their will. Let us looke upon the proſperities of this world as upon faire cryſtall glaſſes, the clearer the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; to day they ſhine, to morrow they breake: If you never truſt them, they will never deceive you.</p>
               <p>Honours, riches, and temporal pleaſures are but the outſide and the barke of proſperity. And it is a ſapleſſe barke, where a good conſcience and reciprocal love betweene God and the ſoule is wanting. But where that is, either it brings out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity or ſupplieth the want of it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. <hi>O God, bleſſed is the man whom thou chooſeſt and cauſeſt to approach unto thee. We ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodnes of thy houſe, even of thy holy temple.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the exerciſe of Vertue in Adverſity.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>PRoſperity and Adverſity are neer neighbours; for proſperity makes preparatives for Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity by blinding mens minds with cupidity, ſwelling them with pride and thruſting them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with raſhnes, whereby they caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves headlong into precipices; and generally by making ſinne to multiplie, which drawes puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Gods juſtice. Beſides the inconſtancy of humane things which in a moment turnes from faire to foule weather.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, Adverſity many times mends the harme done by proſperity, for it repreſſeth temerity, opens the eyes blinded by Paſſion, and brings the ſinner to repentance; Thereby making preparatives for proſperity, which is never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht till one hath bin ſchooled by affliction. Then evill fortune hath her inconſtancy as well as the good, and the calme will come after the ſtorme.</p>
               <p>The proper exerciſe of vertue in Adverſity is to imitate God, who fetcheth good out of it, and makes it a diſcipline of godlines, wiſedome, and tranquillity to his children. It is not enough to hope that after the ſtorme the calme will come, wee muſt ſtudy to find tranquillity in the very tempeſt, and make profit of our damage.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoken of the particular Adverſities in
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170100:190"/>the ſecond booke, I will endeavour here to ſet downe general remedies for all ſorts of Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſaving one, the Adverſity which a delicat man createth to himſelfe out of a conceited ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes; for to ſuch wilfully afflicted perſons the counſells of reaſon are uſeleſſe, till they be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in earneſt. They have need of real afflictions to be healed of imaginary. To them that are ſick with too much eaſe, a ſmarting Adverſity is a wholeſome plaiſter. As to the hypocondriaque who had a falſe opinion of a wound in his left thigh, the ſurgeon made an inciſion in the right, to make him feele the difference betweene real wounds and imaginary.</p>
               <p>Indeed the moſt part of perſons afflicted, are more ſo out of opinion then any true ground; but the wanton melancholy of ſome, that were; all their time dandled in fortunes lap, addeth to that epidemical diſeaſe. Wee will let them alone till they have reaſon to complaine, and deſire them that groane under ſome apparent Adverſities to examine ſeriouſly whether they be ſuch as they appeare; For there are ſome Adverſities, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo, which rather are proſperities, if they that complaine of them can obtaine of themſelves rather to beleeve their owne ſenſe then the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others, and to have no artificial and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe but meerely the natural.</p>
               <p>Thus he that is fallen into disfavour whereby he hath loſt wealth and honours, and hath kept
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170100:190"/>liberty, and bread enough to ſubſiſt retired re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and neglected, is very much obliged, firſt to the envy, and after to the contempt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary prevailing faction, if God give him the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to enjoy the proſperity created by his adverſity. It is a happy misfortune for a little barke, to be caſt by the ſtorme upon a ſmooth ſhore, where the Sea ebbing leaveth it dry but ſafe, while the reſt of the fleet is torne by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt. The wave is more favorable if it thruſt the ſhip upon the haven. Now the godly wiſeman finds a haven any where, becauſe God is every where. Sitting under the ſhelter of his love and providence, he lookes with compaſſion upon the blinde rage of parties fleſht in the blood of one another, praiſing God that he was hurled downe from a ſtage where they are acting a bloody tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, that he may be an actour no more, but a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder onely, diſintereſſed from the publique contradiction. His ruine cannot equal his gaine, if by the loſſe of his eſtate he hath bought his peace, and the uninterrupted contemplation of God, himſelfe, and the world.</p>
               <p>It would be a long taſke to enumerate all the commodious adverſities, for which nevertheleſſe comfort is given and received with great cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Many accidents bitter to us for a time turne afterwards to our great conveniency. Some ſhould have miſſed a great fortune had they not bin repulſed in the purſuite of a leſſer. Many
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170100:191"/>teares are ſhed upon the dead, but more would be ſhed if ſome of them ſhould riſe againe. God hath ſo enterlaced good and evill, that either brings the other. If wee had the patience to let God doe, and the wiſedome to make uſe of all, wee might finde good in moſt part of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</p>
               <p>Many perſons ingenious to their owne torment are like the boulter that lets out the flowre and keepes the bran; they keepe diſgraces and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in their thoughts and let Gods benefits goe out of their minde. It had bin better for them to reſemble the rying ſeeve that lets out ill ſeedes and keepes the good corne, taking off their thoughts from that which is troubleſome in every accident of their life (unleſſe it be to remedy it) &amp; ſetting their mind upon that hath which may yeeld profit or comfort. Thus he that received ſome offence in company by his indiſcretion, in ſtead of making that offenſe an occaſion of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel muſt make it a corrective of his raſhnes. He that is confined within the limits of a houſe and garden, inſtead of grieving that he hath not the liberty of the ſtreet, muſt rejoyce that he hath the liberty of a walke. And how many croſſes come upon us, which being wiſely managed would bring great commodities, if anger troubling our judgement did not make us forgoe the care of our conveniency to attend our appetite of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? Could wee keepe every where equality
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170100:191"/>and ſerenity of ſpirit, wee might ſcape many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, or make them more tolerable, or turne them to our advantage.</p>
               <p>All afflictions are profitable to the wiſe and godly. Even when all is loſt for the temporal, there wants never matter for the principall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which is the ſpiritual. There wee learne to know the perverſity and inconſtancy of the world and the vanity of life, that wee may not repoſe our truſt and bend our affection upon it. Since a curſe is pronounced to the man that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in man, and to him that truſteth in his riches the way to the kingdome of heaven is as impaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the going of a cable through a niedles eye, and, we notwithſtanding theſe divine warnings are ſo prone to truſt and love the world, God therefore in his wiſedome and mercy ſuffers that unſound reed, which wee leane upon, to breake in our hand, and our love of the world to be payd with its hatred, that wee may learne to ſettle our confidence and love in a better place.</p>
               <p>Hereby alſo a man comes to know his ſin and Gods Juſtice. Though we be prone to attribute the good and evill that comes to us unto ſecond cauſes, there is ſuch an affinity betweene ſin and puniſhment, that even in the moſt obdurate hearts affliction brings ſin to mind, and gives remorſe to the conſcience; But in godly ſoules, that remorſe is ſalutary. <hi>David</hi> having ſayd to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Day and night thy hand was heavy upon me, my
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170100:192"/>moiſture is turned into the drought of ſummer,</hi> addeth, <hi>I acknowledged my ſin unto thee &amp; mine iniquity have I not hid; I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſions, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the appetite will run wilde, when proſperity opens the broad gate of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, Adverſity comming upon that, holds a ſhort hand upon the appetite, and awakes piety and wiſedome. <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of this experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy word. ver.</hi> 71. <hi>It is good for me that I have bin afflicted that I might learne thy ſtatutes.</hi> Proſperity is an evill counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and all her adreſſes are to the appetite; but Adverſity croſſing the appetite, calls upon the judgement. Repentance and Faith are ſeldome ſet on work by proſperity; but Adverſity raiſeth our hearts to God, and the feare of danger makes us flee to his Sanctuary. A wiſe godly man will manage affliction for that end, not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe with the firſt pious motions ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by feare and ſorrow; He will husband that accidentall heat of diſtreſſe to warme his zeale, and having ſought God out of neceſſity, he will ſeeke him out of love. The unkind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement he findes in the world will helpe him to take off his affection from it, and tranſport his heart where his treaſure is. Acknowledging Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity to be the wages of ſin, he will learne to walk before God in feare, and from the feare of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:170100:192"/>his judgements he will riſe to the feare of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, eſteeming that the greateſt Adverſity, not to beare his heavy plagues, but to tranſgreſs his holy will.</p>
               <p>This filial feare of God is the way to prevent or avert many afflictions; for they that humble themſelves in proſperity need not to be humbled by Adverſity. Many times the repentance of the ſinner hath wreſted the deſtroying ſword out of Gods hand: Many times when good men have bin beſet on all ſides, the feare of God hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them a gate to go out; for <hi>he that feareth God ſhall come forth of all. Ecceſ.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all: he keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken. Pſal.</hi> 34.19. Many are the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the righteous, becauſe God formeth him to patience and perfecteth his faith by long exerciſe, which endeth in comfort; as he wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with <hi>Jacob</hi> a whole night, and bleſt him in the morning. He deales otherwiſe with the wicked, for he lets them thrive a while, but when he takes them in hand with his juſtice he deſtroyeth them utterly. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.7. <hi>When the wicked ſpring as the graſs, and when all the workers of iniquity do flouriſh, it is that they ſhal be deſtroyed for ever.</hi> God exerciſed his people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with diverſe trials for forty yeares in the wilderneſs, but he extermined the <hi>Cananites</hi> ſuddenly. God forbid we ſhould be of thoſe to whom he gives but one blow. Rather
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170100:193"/>let him wreſtle with us a long time with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly hand, which with the tryall brings ſtrength to them that are tryed, and gives them the crowne in the end of the combar. Here is the patience and the faith of Saints.</p>
               <p>Our very nature ought to acquaint us with adverſity: For ſuffering is the naturall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men. <hi>Job.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Is there not a warfarre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to man upon earth?</hi> To be caſt downe with ſorrow for the adverſities incident unto mans life ſheweth ignorance of our condition. The way not to be ſurpriſed with any thing is to be prepared for all; and to think that the evill which happens to one man may happen to any other, ſince all are men alike. As at dice whoſoever playeth is ſubject to all the caſts of the dice; he that is engaged in the game of life is ſubject to all the events incident to the living, and muſt be prepared for them.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it is not fortune but providence that diſpoſeth of the accidents of life, the greater is our obligation to beare good &amp; evill accidents with a holy equanimity, becauſe all that happens to us is unavoidable, as ordained by a fatal and eternal law.</p>
               <p>Upon that wee muſt conceive as well as wee can that humane events and ſeveral perſonal intereſſes are ſo interwoven by that high provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they have a mutual dependance among themſelves; and their meetings, which in
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170100:193"/>our regard are caſual, are twice neceſſary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God, both becauſe they are decreed in his counſell, and becauſe they are requiſite for the execution of many things. To which if wee adde, that God all-wiſe and all-good doeth nothing &amp; permitteth nothing but for a good end, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably complaine of any croſſe befalling us, though wee had not deſerved it: For wee muſt conſider ourſelves, as pieces of the univerſe, and engeenes which that great workman ſets on go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the execution of his ends, which being all good, all meanes alſo tending to them are good in that regard. Our croſſes then being determined and directed to ſome good by the good hand of God (which wee muſt firmely beleeve) we muſt alſo beleeve them to be good, becauſe they ſerve for Gods end which is alwayes good. So not onely wee muſt beare them with patience, but receive them with content, yea with thankes; rejoycing, as happy, that even in ſuffering wee are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the good hand of God, to doe his work and advance his glory; which many times we ſee not, but he ſeeth it, and that muſt ſilence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent us.</p>
               <p>Being thus diſpoſed, this advantage we have above many of the wheeles and weights of that great machine of Providence, that whereas ſome of them have no will, ſome an ill will, our will is acting with Gods will, and our love to him bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our ſelfelove to his pleaſure, ſo that for his
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170100:194"/>glories ſake (into which all things end) our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions appeare good unto us; and ſo they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſince by them God is glorified.</p>
               <p>Events being thus chained up and interlaced together, it is a great injuſtice againſt God and the order by him ſettled in the univerſe, to grudge at any thing that happens to us, as though wee would have God to unweave in our behalfe the web of his providence, create a new decree, and make a new counſel-booke for us. Let us goe willingly where Gods decree leads us, for goe wee muſt howſoever; Is it not better to goe ſtreight forward where God will have us to goe, then to be dragged backwards?</p>
               <p>Indeed there is no need of a high reach of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to perſwade a man to bear with, unavoydable accidents, and to will that which it were to no purpoſe not to will. But when wee conſider be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is the will of God, if wee be his true children we ſhall will cheerefully what he wills.</p>
               <p>When we are in proſperity there is no praiſe to will what God willes, for then God willes what wee will. But that is pleaſing to God to conſent to his will when he ſmites us, and to ſay after the Lord Jeſus, the patterne of all perfection. <hi>Father not as I will but as thou wilt.</hi> That reſolution brings a great reſt and a great perfection to the ſoul; for by that meanes our will is changed into Gods will. The way to have all our will is to will nothing but what God wils.</p>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:170100:194"/>
               <p>When God ſends us affliction, thereby He gives us a great matter to glorifie him and to draw a bleſſing upon ourſelves; For whereas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable Adverſities make us worſe when we pull againſt them, they worke in us a peaceable fruit of righteouſnes, when we not onely beare them patiently, but receive them joyfully as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from God. I verily beleeve that God beholds nothing from heaven that pleaſeth him more then a will ſo ſubjected and united to His, that in the midſt of afflictions he finds Gods will good, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and perfect; and ſaith, Gods will bed one, He is all good and all wiſe. And ſince he is as abſolute and irreſiſtible in his power as he is good and wiſe in his will, it would be as fooliſh a part for me to hope to overcome it, as impious to offer to contradict it. This is the principal counſel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Adverſity, yea the onely, for we ſhould need no other, if we were come ſo far as to have no will but Gods will.</p>
               <p>But to that high counſel many inferiour coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are ſubſervient. Such is this: When God ſends us adverſity, that we may not thinke it ſtrange to be ſo uſed, let us compare ourſelves with ſo many others that are in a worſe caſe. If we be priſoners in ourowne Country, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſo many Chriſtians that are captives of the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Moores.</hi> Have we ſuffered ſome loſſe in our eſtates? we need not goe farre from home
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170100:195"/>to ſee whole nations driven out of their antient poſſeſſions, ſhut out of their Country, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to mendicity. Are you lame of a legge? Looke upon your neighbour that hath loſt both his legges by a cannonſhot. Thus the evils of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will be lenitives to yours.</p>
               <p>It is a wholeſome counſell to be more carefull to keepe a reckoning of the goods that remaine with us then of thoſe we have loſt. He that hath loſt his land, muſt thank God that he hath kept his health. He that hath loſt health and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall goods, muſt thank God that none can take from him the eternall goods. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath leſſe then he deſireth muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he hath more then he deſerveth. It is the way to keepe ourſelves in humility before God and men, and in tranquillity at home, and turne murmuring into thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>And whereas the remembrance of dead friends and loſt goods fill us with ſorrow, it ought to fill us with joy. If the poſſeſsion of them was pleaſant why ſhould the remembrance be ſad? Why ſhould wee entertaine more ſadneſs becauſe we loſt them, then joy becauſe we had them? it is the ordinary unthankfulnes of the world to reckon all the goods of the time paſt for nothing. At the leaſt affliction a long courſe of precedent proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is loſt and forgotten; like a cleare ſtreame falling into a ſink, and loſing its pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ordure. Let us thank God for all the good
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170100:195"/>dayes of our life, ſo may me make preſent ill dayes good by the remembrance of good dayes paſt, and obtaine of God new matter of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. We muſt uſe the world as a feaſt, uſing ſoberly and cheerefully the fare that is before us, and when it is taken away, We muſt riſe and give thankes. We may juſtly be taxed as greedy gheſts unthankfull to the maſter of the feaſt, that hath ſo liberally feaſted us, if we Grudge when he calls to take away, inſtead of Thanking him for his good cheere. As he is our magnificent Inviter he is our wiſe Phyſitian. Sometimes he ſets his good plenty before us, ſometimes he keepes us to ſhort dyet: Let us receive both with an equall and thankfull mind. All his dealing with us is wiſedome and bounty.</p>
               <p>Here let us remember this Maxime which I layd before as a maine ground of our tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the things which we loſe are none of ours, elſe we could not have loſt them. We were borne naked, all that was put about us ſince, is none of ours. Yea all that was borne with us is not ours, Our health, our limbs, our body, our life, may be taken away from us by others. We muſt not then reckon them as ours. But our ſoul which cannot be taken away, and the beſt riches of our mind, are truly ours. All loſſes and paines fall onely upon the leaſt part of ourſelves which is our body, and the ſenſes and paſſions that are moſt conjoyned unto it, if we may call
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:170100:196"/>that a part of man, without which a man is whole. But the true man which is the ſoul is out of the worlds reach, and with it all the Chriſtian vertues. For which reaſon our Saviour bids us not to feare them that can kill the body and cannot kill the ſoul. To be much caſt downe with temporall loſſes ſhewes emptineſs of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall riches; &amp; to be very impatient of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the body ſhewes that one hath more commerce with the body then with themind, elſe a man might find matter enough of joy in the ſoul to conterpoyſe worldly loſſes and bodily paines.</p>
               <p>As a body that hath the noble parts ſound will eaſily inure it ſelfe to beare cold and heat, and all the injuries of the aire; Likewiſe, he that hath a ſound ſoul, and is ſtrong within in faith, integrity, divine love, and right reaſon, wherein the true health of the ſoul conſiſteth, will eaſily beare with all Adverſities; and retiring within himſelfe when he is aſſaulted without, he will take care before all things that it may be well with his inſide, and that nothing there, be put out of order by the diſorders without.</p>
               <p>That ſerene ſtate of the ſoul is the fitteſt for the vertue of prudence and the exerciſe of it in Adverſity. For to get out of the difficulties of life wee muſt maintaine our judgement free and our conſcience ſound: And if the Adverſity be of ſuch a nature that it be paſt the helpe of prudence (ſuch as are ſharpe &amp; incurable paines;) yet there
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:170100:196"/>is none but may be eaſed by reaſon, faith, and the comforts of Gods love. For what? Life is ſhort, no evil is very great when it hath an end, No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily paine can laſt longer then our bodies, and no Adverſity of Gods children either of body or ſpirit can continue longer then life. But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſurances of our peace with God, and the ſweet entertainment of his love to us, and ours to him, are earneſts and beginnings of a felicity without end. By them the ſoule ſhut up in this priſon of fleſh looks out with her head forth, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to flye away. She riſeth againe with Chriſt in this very world by a lively hope. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. She ſeekes thoſe things that are above, where Chriſt is ſitting in the glory of his father. She is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven already, and hath onely the body upon earth.</p>
               <p>To this the afflictions of our body contribute much. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>For our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a farre more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. While wee looke not at the things which are ſeene but at the things which are not ſeene; for the things which are ſeene are temporal, but the things which are not ſeene are eternal; for wee know that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wee have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, ternal in the heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a high point of reſolution and joy in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which pagan Philoſophie could never reach, to beare the afflictions of this life cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:170100:197"/>out of hope of eternal felicity after death. It is pittiful to behold what paine theſe old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers tooke to arme themſelves againſt death, and how the ſeeming lofty peace wherewith they marcht towards death is like that of a ſtarting hors blowing and pricking up his eares at the entry of a dark place, whereas the good Chriſtian goeth gently to it, with ſimplicity, joy, and conſidence. Why? the Pagans knew not whither they went, and conceived of death as of a ghaſtly darke denne; but the right Chriſtian ſeeth his way, and thinking of death, ſaith, <hi>I know whom I have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> He <hi>gives thankes to the father who hath made him meet to be partaker of the inheritance of the Saints in light:</hi> His <hi>deſire is to depart and to be with Chriſt,</hi> remembring that Chriſt went before, and ſayd to all his diſciples, both preſent and to come, when he went up to heaven, <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you.</hi> So whereas pagan Philoſophy ſeekes comforts againſt death, Chriſtian Philoſophy preſenteth death, as a comfort. Fellons condemned to the gallowes heare not with ſo much joy the grace and pardon that giveth them life, as good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans heare the glad tidings of their approaching death; for death is a grace unto them, ſince it opens them the priſon doore. If they be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſick, the way to cheere them up is not to ſay, <hi>Be of good heart, you ſhall recover,</hi> but, <hi>be of good heart, you muſt dye;</hi> for they conceive of death as of their haven of ſalvation after a ſtormy voyage.
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:170100:197"/>That hope ſweetens all their Adverſities. It is a corke that keepes up their ſpirits above the moſt raging waves, not ſuffering it to ſinke under any ſorrow: It is the charme of all cares which makes the Chriſtian to ſay when he loſeth his earthly goods, Now I am unloaden of that luggage, I am the lighter for my journey to the Kingdome of heaven, and there I have my true goods which no man can take from me. So were the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> diſpoſed, that <hi>received with joy the ſpoyling of their goods, knowing in themſelves that they had in heaven a better and an enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Heb.</hi> 10.34.</p>
               <p>This alſo makes the Chriſtian diſgeſt injuries, and contemne contempt, ſaying, Earth is not the Country where am I to expect glory, I ſhall have enough in heaven ſhortly. I am little concerned in the Opinion of men during this life of few dayes, and I am yet leſſe concerned in that they ſhall ſay of me after my death.</p>
               <p>Of all ſufferings, the ſufferings for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have the ſureſt comfort, Chriſt ſaying ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.10.12. <hi>Bleſſed are they that are perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake, for theirs is the Kingdome of God. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.</hi> Since <hi>by many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we muſt enter into the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> we perceive by the thornes which we were told we ſhould finde in the way, that we are in the right; Any way is pleaſant that leads us to ſalvation.</p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:170100:198"/>
               <p>Finally this heavenly hope abates the tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſickneſs, and the chagreene of old age. For the godly ſoul finding her houſe of fleſh rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall, prepareth herſelf with joy to come out at the breach; and finding the race of this life neere done, ſtretcheth herſelfe towards the prize, which the great Saviour holds her up, from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thus faith is found to be the moſt ſublime Philoſophy, for it takes off the heart from things tranſitory, and raiſeth it up to the eternall. It is the chiefe valour, for it is victor over dolour, and armeth the weake with invincible ſtrength. It makes the Chriſtian to walke in the midſt of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities with a reſolute and undanted march, and to grow familiar with death, finding in the principall ſubject of humane feares the great ſubject of his confidence and joy, and in the croſs a ladder to glory.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur firſt Book hath bin imployed about the Peace of man with God, The three following about the peace of man with himſelfe. To confirme himſelfe in theſe, his next care muſt be to have peace with his owne kind. For in vaine ſhould we hope to keepe peace with God and our owne ſelves, if we live in wilfull diſcord with our neighbours; theſe are things altogether inconſiſtent. <hi>If a man ſay, I love God and hateth his brother, he is a lyar; for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeene, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeene?</hi> and if a man be at odds with God and his brother, how can he have peace at home?</p>
               <p>We are commanded to <hi>follow peace with all men. Heb.</hi> 12.14. Which becauſe it is more eaſy to follow then to obtaines the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares us to meet with oppoſition by theſe
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:170100:199"/>termes, <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lyeth in you, live peaceably with all men. Rom.</hi> 12.18. Now what lyeth in us (with Gods aſſiſting grace) to live peaceably with all men, is expreſt in two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in the words next before, The firſt is <hi>to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe no man evill for evill.</hi> It is impoſſible to go through the croud of the world and not to be thruſt. Fooles returne the like and thruſt againe, and thruſting brings ſtriking; The wiſe paſſe quiet and unconcerned. As we muſt beare one with another for Gods ſake that commands it, we muſt do it for our own ſake to keep tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of mind; the loſſe whereof cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced by any ſatisfaction of revenge, if revenge ever brought any. Moſt part of injuries conſiſting in opinion the remedy conſiſteth in the ſame. They hurt not him that reſents them not. <hi>Injuriarum remedium eſt oblivio.</hi> But if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury bee ſuch that we muſt needs reſent it, Pardoning is the beſt reſenting, and the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableſt revenge of all is, To recompence good for evill.</p>
               <p>The other counſell is, <hi>Provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men.</hi> For whether we live with good or bad men, which are the greater number, it were impoſſible for us to compaſſe all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes if they were <hi>layd open in the ſight of all men,</hi> they muſt be ſo honeſt that when they are ripe for the knowledge of all men we need not be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them. And if in the following of honeſt and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:170100:199"/>beneficial deſignes we meete with oppoſition, we muſt behave ourſelves with ſo much meekenes that we make it appeare that we ſeeke not our advantage by the ruine of others, and together with ſo much vigour that none be encouraged by our puſillanimity to croſſe us.</p>
               <p>There is no harder taſke then to keepe ourſelves free from diſſention in this age; which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the reigne of diſcord. Here then wee muſt beſtow the greater care to keep tranquillity in our converſation, and more in our minde.</p>
               <p>As for publique quarrels, a wiſe man will wedde himſelfe to no party with eagernes; and if it be poſſible, he will looke upon the game, and himſelfe neither play nor bet. He will leave the zeale of State to them that hold themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be exempted from common diſtreſſes. He will remember that he is a citizen of a better countrey then that where he was borne. Who ſo takes a great intereſſe in publique affaires, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereby that he hath a great love to the world, and eſteemes it more then it is worth; for we may be ſure that, which party ſoever prevaile, fooles will prevaile, for ſuch are all men, and in the commotion of a State, as of a muddy river, the mire and foame will alwayes be the uppermoſt. If it be paſt our power to part them, let them fight it out, and let our part be to looke with judgement and compaſſion how the vials of Gods wrath are powred firſt upon the minds of men to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170100:200"/>confound them with a fierce and blind impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, whereby they runne and prey one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; next upon Empires &amp; ſtates to turne them upſide downe. Of which an image is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſixteenth Chapter of the Revelation where a viall is powred upon the Sunne whereby he is made hot and ſcorching beyond meaſure, and preſently another vial is powred upon the ſeat of the Beaſt, wherewith his kingdome is filled with darknes, and infeſted with ſore and ſmarting plagues. For a mans ſpirit is within him that which the Sunne is in the world. When the ſpirits of a people are kindled with a malignant heate, a darke confuſion of the State and the miſeries of the particular members of it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. That man is bleſſed who in ſuch an epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical turbulent heat, keepes the meekenes and ſerenity of his mind. And although it be hardly poſſible for him not to be carried away by the ſtreame of that party where his private intereſſes happen to be engaged, yet he keeps his ſoul free, heavenly, peaceable charitable to his greateſt enemies, and praying for them that perſecute him.</p>
               <p>In all times and places a wiſe Chriſtian will abhorre warre. It is the very empire of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; and in nothing ſo much doth he ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the Prince of this world. It is the diſcipline of robbery and murder. It is the deep gulfe of all miſery. It is the ſinck of all wickedneſſe and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:170100:200"/>vilany. Yet the beſt men are often engaged in it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of conſcience &amp; duty, for every one oweth his life to the defence of his Country. But for one to love the trade of <hi>Manbutcher,</hi> and delight in the hunting of man his owne kind, as others do in the hunting of the wolfe or wild boare, is an unnaturall barbarouſneſſe, not valour. Who ſo will keep the integrity and ſerenity of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and hopeth for the ſalvation of his ſoul, muſt keep himſelfe free from that inhumane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, the true image of Satan, who was a murtherer from the beginning. Gods children are children of peace, which they entertaine in their mind and advance by their prayers and counſels.</p>
               <p>There is another warre in the midſt of peace, little better then that where the quarrell is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the ſword, the warre of lawſuites, the diſcipline of cutting mens throats with a pen. There robbery is committed by the due forms of law, there men are flayed alive for others to cloath themſelves with their skin. There the profeſſion of giving to every man his owne, is turned by the profeſſours into an invention to make every mans goods their owne. The conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions infinite in number and length, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring trade of law tricks, is the great plague of theſe Weſterne Provinces of Europe, and the greate ſhame of Chriſtendome while the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan <hi>Moores,</hi> our neighbours, diſpatch ſuites in
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:170100:201"/>an hour, without appeale or writ of errour. He that knowes how to value that precious peace with God and himſelfe, and deſires to keep it, will endure great extremities before he try that remedy worſe then moſt ſickneſſes; following St. <hi>Pauls</hi> leſſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>There is utterly a fault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you becauſe ye go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather ſuffer your ſelves to be defrauded?</hi> And if he be yet to choſe his civill profeſſion, he ſhall do wiſely not to betake himſelfe to thoſe profeſſions that live by the contentiouſneſſe of others. But if he find himſelfe neceſſarily engaged in the practiſe of Law, he muſt behave himſelf in it as a child of peace, ſewing up againe, as much as in him ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, what others have rent; like good Princes which never draw their ſwords but to have peace. Look upon that tumultuous clamorous, &amp; miſchievous buſtle, &amp; then account it no ſmall happineſſe to live far from an aire ſo contrary to the tranquillity of mind, and the integrity and ſerenity of conſcience.</p>
               <p>There are other diſſenſions without law, and many times without conſcience, which begin in envy, ſuſpicions, credulity to reports, &amp; in words ill intended or ill taken, proceeding from words to blowes and many times ending in deſtruction. The worſt effect is within, the breach of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace with God in a mans ſelfe, and the inbittering of the ſpirit, both of the offendor and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:170100:201"/>the offended, unleſſe he be of a very milde, and godly, and Philoſophical temper.</p>
               <p>To avoyd thoſe troubleſome encounters, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> precept muſt be obſerved. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.24. <hi>Make no friendſhip with an angry man, and with a furious man thou ſhalt not go.</hi> But becauſe thoſe that muſt of neceſſity converſe with many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pick their company, and much leſſe change the manners of thoſe with whom they converſe, they muſt ſo govern and temper their owne, by piety and judgement, as never to give a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to any.</p>
               <p>Truly there is no fence againſt unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and proud anger will be offenſive though unprovoked. Our part muſt be to breake ſuch mens choller with patience, as woolſacks and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions full of earth are ſet before the battery of cannons. St <hi>Pauls</hi> precept <hi>to give place unto wrath, Rom.</hi> 12.19, is as wiſe as it is holy; for wrath groweth by oppoſition, but ſpends it ſelfe when one gives it place. If you be fiercely perſued by a ſerpent, do but ſtep aſide, the ſerpent will ruſh ſtraight on and miſſe you. And if you be ſet upon by impetuous choler, give it place by a gentle declination, it will paſſe-by harmleſs. Or if you receive reall injury from an angry man, expect no ſatisfaction from him while he is ſo, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from him in hot blood to himſelfe in cold blood.</p>
               <p>Contentious inſolent men being generally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:170100:202"/>of ſmall worth, it is a ſordid and unworthy imployment to contend with them: For as friendſhip makes friends equal, quarrells workes the like effect. If we contend with a drunkard or a loggerhead, we make him our fellow. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Anſwere not a foole according to his folly, leaſt thou alſo be like unto him.</hi> If you debate with a foole, you muſt imitate him, for the debate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth you to follow him in all his extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>That contention may not reach us, we muſt ſtand far from the contentions of others, and free ourſelves of that popular folly to run and croud to heare unknowne perſons that are at high words, and be preſently intereſſed in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, as when two dogs are fighting, all the dogs of the ſtreet will run to them, and take parts. A good and wiſe man will ſeek to make peace where poſſibility invites him, but where he ſeeth that he can do no good to others he will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do harme to himſelfe. Mediations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they have a great meaſure of goodneſs and diſcretion, make the differences wider and beare the blow on both ſides.</p>
               <p>To that end a wiſeman will be none of the forwardeſt to give his judgement of every thing, and none of the affirmative and great diſputants, that will ſet forth all their opinions, and evince them by ſtrength of argument: but he will be <hi>ſwift to heare, ſlow to ſpeake, ſlow to wrath,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:170100:202"/>commandeth <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.19. In which words hee giveth a character of a wiſe man in converſation, that heares all, makes profit of all, determines of nothing, and is moved at nothing.</p>
               <p>And whereas there is in all men good and bad a certaine reſpect of truth and righteouſnes, which at the hearing of untruth and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes will worke a ſudden averſion in the minde, if we will keepe an inoffenſive courſe in converſing with the world, we muſt learne to ſilenſe that averſion, and not let it appeare abroad without an eſpeciall order of our ſerious judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, accuſtoming our eyes and eares and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to an unmoved patience, not thinking ourſelves obliged to oppoſe all the lyes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies of every one that we meete with, but onely when the good name of God is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly blaſphemed. We ought to beare in mind that things true and juſt in our opinions in the opinion of all others. That we cannot juſtly claime the liberty of enjoying our opinions unleſſe we leave the ſame liberty to others. That our minds, as all the reſt of mankinde, are ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted and wrapt up in errour. And we are to give account of our owne, not of other mens fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. For one to beare himſelfe as the repairer of all wrongs and reformer of all that is amiſſe in the world, is an humour that hath much of the veine of old romanſes. Crafty and ambitious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers have often got ſtrength by that weakenes of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:170100:203"/>vulgar ſoules, yea have made even the true zeale to Gods glory tributary to their ambition.</p>
               <p>Truly for ſo high a ſubject as Gods glory our reaſon, our will, our Paſſion, our words, and our actions muſt be ſet on worke. But we muſt take a carefull heed of miſtaking madnes for zeale, and ſuperſtition for religion. Neither muſt we think that for ſuch good ends as we may conceive any way is lawfull; there being nothing more cruel and pernicious then a baſtard and fanatical zeale. It is the plague of religion, the ruine of the State, and undoing of human ſociety. Better were it to live a ſlave in the chaines of <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Tripoli,</hi> where the bodies are miſuſed without violence to the conſcience, then to be yoaked to the tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome converſation of a fierce, ſcrupulous, &amp; cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous bigot, that will be at peace with no man unleſſe every one beleeve at his mode, though himſelfe knoweth not what he beleeveth; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth reſt neither to himſelf or to others. Who ſo loveth his peace will keepe himſelfe from the torture of ſuch an odious companion, and will be yet more careful to keepe his minde free of that impetuous weakenes diſguized with the name of holy zeale and wiſedome. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That wiſedome deſcendeth not from above, but is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſenſual, devilliſh; For where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evill worke. But the wiſedome that is from above, is firſt pure, then peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:170100:203"/>good fruits, without partiality and without hypocriſy. And the fruit of righteouſnes is ſowne in peace of them that love peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chiefe way to keepe peace in Society, is meekenes. It takes up quarrels, and tyeth againe the knot of love when it happens to be untyed. It is the balſame that healeth the wounds made in friendſhip. It is the lenitive of injuries. It is the preſerver of peace with God, with men, and with ourſelves. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.11. <hi>The meeke ſhall inherite the earth, and ſhall delight themſelves in the abundance of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a baſtard meekenes which is nothing elſe but a baſe &amp; timorous nature, whereby a man yields all and to all, becauſe he is afraid of all. If that diſpoſition ſerveth ſometimes to prevent diſcord, it ſerveth more often to provoke it; for it invites contempt, and gives faire play to inſolence. It is farre from maintaining peace within, as true meekenes doeth; for it keepes the mind in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual feare, and fills it with diffidence and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. But true meekenes is a compound of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, charity, and generoſity, whereby we keepe concord with our neighbours becauſe we love them; And to avoyd quarrel, call prudence and ſometimes diſdaine, to the helpe of patience; let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ill words goe by, as haile clattering over our roofe, and after a noiſe without effect, falling to the ground, and melting of itſelfe.</p>
               <p>A meeke generous man will be ingenious to
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:170100:204"/>deviſe excuſes for them that offend him: alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, ſometimes the age, ſometimes the ſexe, ſometimes the ſicknes of the body, ſometimes that of the minde: He will ſay, This man is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcontented; affliction makes men froward, he deſerves rather pitty then anger: That other man hath offended me unwittingly, or he was ill informed; If he layeth a falſe imputation upon me, he ſheweth that he knoweth me not, I muſt not be angry with a man for miſtaking me for another. If he deale unrighteouſly with me, I muſt conſider that all unrighteouſnes proceeds of errour; He hath more need to be taught then puniſht; I muſt not hate a man becauſe he is out of his way: In the offence done to me God is offended firſt, God then muſt firſt reſſent it; Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is Gods not mine. If he that offendeth me is one of Gods children he is beloved of him, and I muſt not hate him whom God loveth. If he be wicked and will never repent of his wickednes, I need not procure him evill, God is his enemy, and will be ſure to make him eternally miſerable: But becauſe, for any thing I know, he may repent and be reconciled with God, which I muſt wiſh and hope for, I muſt not be enemy to him that may be Gods friend eternally; He and I were beſt to be friends on earth leaſt we never meete in heaven.</p>
               <p>As in wreſtling, ſo in injuries, that man is the ſtrongeſt who is leſſe moved. The beſt victory
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:170100:204"/>over an enemy is to make him our friend. It is double victory; for ſo a man overcometh both his adverſary and himſelfe.</p>

               <p>TO live in concord with our neighbours we muſt love them, otherwiſe all our compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and dexterity to keepe concord will be but diſſimulation, and though it get us peace abroad it will not give us peace within. <hi>My little children; ſaith</hi> St. <hi>John let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but indeed and in truth.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18. Then he addeth that <hi>hereby wee know that wee are of the truth, and aſſure our hearts before God.</hi> A text, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that charity to our neighbours fills the minde with ſaith, peace, and aſſurance: a doctrine, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the experience of meek and charitable ſoules. The ſame charity that unites us with Chriſt as our head, unites us alſo with our neighbours as his members, or at leaſt as his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that beare his image: In the one or the other of theſe relations we muſt love all men for Gods ſake, and render to them all poſſible duties of humanity.</p>
               <p>To the practice of theſe duties we are more eſpecially called by the neceſſity of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and by their vertue. Neceſſity affords us a perpetual occaſion of charity. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.11 <hi>For ye
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:170100:205"/>have the poore alwayes with you,</hi> ſaith the Lord Jeſus. Others that are not poore in eſtate are poore in counſel, or health, or friends, or comfort: Let every body give of that he hath, to him that hath not, and he ſheweth charity to the rich if he doe him good expecting no reward.</p>
               <p>Workes of charity doe good both to him that is relieved and to him that relieveth. But he that doeth good, gets more reliefe by it then he to whom it is done: for <hi>it is a thing more happy to give then to receive, Act.</hi> 20.35. ſaith St <hi>Paul</hi> after Chriſt; firſt becauſe of the good treaſure which is layd up thereby for the future, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.25. <hi>The liberal ſoul ſhall be made fat, and he that watereth ſhall be watered alſo himſelfe.</hi> Giving charitably is caſting a ſeed bringing an everlaſting harveſt. It is ſending up ſweete vapours to heaven which are thickened there into a raine of bleſſings to ſhowre downe upon the head of the charitable perſon. To which we may joine the great and preſent content accrewing to the ſoule in the very act of giving, for good workes give a ready pay to the doers. This made Solomon to ſay <hi>The merciful man doeth good to his owne ſoul, Prov.</hi> 11.17 for the workes of mercy give a great joy to the doer. And he that gives his bread to the poore is more ſatiſfied with it then he that eates it. It is a divine felicity to doe good to many, for it is the greateſt imitation of God, who gives to all and is never weary of doing good. Herein onely
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:170100:205"/>dignities and riches are good, that they enable a willing mind to doe much good.</p>
               <p>As the neceſſity of our neighbours invites us to charity ſo doth their Vertue, which is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter invitation. The firſt ſort of Charity, which regards more the need then the worth of the perſon, is <hi>humanity and mercy;</hi> that which regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Vertue is <hi>friendſhip,</hi> or at leaſt a beginning of it.</p>
               <p>Friendſhip, to deſerve fully that name, muſt be reciprocall, the parties loving one another dearely becauſe they deſerve it, and becauſe they ſee the graces of God each in the other. Friendſhip that regards profit and pleaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth not that name ſince it is neither for the love of God, nor for the love of the perſon that ſuch a Friendſhip is contracted, but out of ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love.</p>
               <p>Friendſhip cemented by Vertue, and riveted by likeneſs in inclinations, manners, and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, is the ſweeteſt of all human things. For beſides counſell and mutuall help, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of enterchanging thoughts and diſcharging cares in the boſome one of another, the union of affections, and the aſſurance to be beloved of the beloved perſon, is a content not to be expreſt; &amp; there is ſomething heavenly in that harmony. It is a little imitation of the union between the perſons of the Trinity which make themſelves happy by their mutuall love. There is nothing
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:170100:206"/>neither in heaven nor in earth that giveth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent but friendſhip. Nothing is pleaſant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. And if I were asked what is the greateſt of all joyes, I would ſay that it <hi>is to love, and to be loved againe, and know it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it muſt be acknowledged that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and felicity is more in Idea then in reality among men, and we muſt go higher then human Society, to find it. For whereas it is hard to find a vertuous man in the world, it is harder to find two. And it is harder yet to make theſe two meet in opinions, in inclinations, in intereſſes, in place of habitation, and in the like courſe of life; for the want of one of theſe particulars hinders the knitting of the bond of friendſhip, or makes it ſhortlived, or abates the comfort of it.</p>
               <p>The deſcription which <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophy forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of perfect friendſhip is a fair imagination of an impoſſible thing; They require two friends or three at the moſt, but ſuch as were never found, endowed with perfect vertue; That for that vertue theſe perſons love one another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other obligation or collaterall reſpect. That theſe perfect ſoules be ſo plunged and blended one within another that they can not owne themſelves ſingled and aſunder. That they be but one ſoul dwelling in ſeverall bodyes. That a friend give himſelfe ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his friend that he live no more but for him,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:170100:206"/>yea in him; and that his goods, as himſelfe, be his friends, whoſe intereſſes he wholly ſeekes, not his owne.</p>
               <p>I wonder that among Chriſtian Philoſophers none hath hitherto obſerved (for any thing I know) what it was that bred that Idea of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſo high and remote from the nature of things, in the fancy of <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophers, which yet placed vertue and felicity in living according to Nature; &amp; why they have ſo univerſally ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that chimera which is found no where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, like the <hi>Athenians</hi> that had ſet up an Altar to the unknowne God.</p>
               <p>This is then the origine and ground of that high imagination of thoſe <hi>Pagans.</hi> They had found by ſearching the nature of man, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make him happy, but love; And that for a beatificall love a man hath need of an object all good, all wiſe, and all perfect; ſo perfectly united with him, yea ſo totally, that both paſſe the one into the other and make a mutuall free and abſolute gift of themſelves. But the poore men did not know that object of tranſcendent goodneſs, onely worthy to be loved with all the heart and ſoul: and if ſome of them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged God to be the Soveraine good, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved not that he could have ſuch a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with man that both might enterchange a mutuall gift of their owne ſelves; ſo, that man ſhould dwell in God, and God in man. Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:170100:207"/>not then that there might be a contract of friendſhip betweene God and man, and ſeeing that it is friendſhip that muſt make man happy, they forged that Idea of friendſhip betweene man &amp; man, of which the condition of man is not capable, requiring for that friendſhip that which indeed is requiſite for felicity, but together is impoſſible to nature. For ſo farre they ſay true, that for a perfect love the ſoul of a friend muſt paſſe into his friends ſoul. But that being impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and hyperbolically aſcribed to love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen men, is true and reall in the friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man ſanctified, eſpecially when he is glorified; For God graceth man ſo much as to make him his friend, and to call him ſo, <hi>I have called you my friends</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15. And in that friendſhip there is ſuch a ſtrict union between God and the ſoul, that thereby the ſoul is refunded into her original being. The ſpirit of God gets into mans ſpirit, and the ſpirit of man poures it ſelfe into Gods ſpirit, as the river falls into the Sea and the Sea floweth into the river; Their wills become one, their intereſſes one, the glory of God and the ſalvation of man become the ſame thing; Man ſeeking above all things to glorifie God glorifyeth himſelfe, and is advanced by deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe out of his love to God, till finally ſeeing God, and being ſeene of him, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. he is <hi>changed into the ſame image, and made
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:170100:207"/>partaker of the divine nature.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Pagans</hi> from their contemplations upon friendſhip paſſe to examples, they ſhew how remote their imaginations are from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, and that their characters of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip are fitter to be lookt on than copied out. For none of theſe paires of friends, which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity extolls, is come neere thoſe compleat I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas which they fancy. Moſt of them that would ſtrive to expreſſe them in their practice have made themſelves miſerable, and their friendſhip a bondage. Alſo among the vertuous examples of friendſhip, they ſet forth vicious preſidents; as that of <hi>Bloſius</hi> who being convented before the Senate about the ſedition of <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> whoſe intimate friend he was, and asked what he would have done for him, anſwered that he would have done any thing at his requeſt. And what (ſayd the Judges) if he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted thee to ſet the Temples on fire, wouldſt thou have done it? I know, replyed he, that <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> would never have had ſuch a will, but if he had deſired it of me, I would have done it. I am ſcandalized to ſee that anſwere commended by Chriſtian writers, <hi>Montagne</hi> and <hi>Carron.</hi> Let them comment upon it as much as they pleaſe, it is certaine that ſuch a deference to a friend's will, is the higheſt homage that the creature can make unto the Creatour, whoſe will is the onely rule of righteouſneſſe. If any preferre his
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:170100:208"/>friends will before the obſervation of that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine will, his amity is enmity againſt God, and becomes a plot and a conſpiracy to offend him.</p>
               <p>Theſe old characters of perfect friendſhip per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade ſome to imitate them, but commonly they are young men, that know neither how to chooſe what they ought to love, nor how to love what they have choſen; and they that chooſe a friend with moſt judgement, and preſerve him with moſt care ſoone find that human nature, though inricht with grace, affords neither the perfect objects, nor the firme bond, nor the ſolid content of Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Yet ſince we live in the world, we muſt make friends in it, and leaving heroique characters to romances, content ourſelves with ſuch as the earth beares, and neighbourhood preſents; chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them ſuch as have, at leaſt, piety, honeſty, and ingenuity; matching ourſelves with our equalls, or rather a little above us then under, preſerving their love by reſpect and good offices, and converſing with them with a cheerfull and innocent facility</p>
               <p>But ſeeing that a great affection is a great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, filling the minde with care and feare, he that loveth his owne tranquillity will take heed how he engageth himſelfe in a friendſhip whoſe value doth not recompenſe the intereſſe he takes in it, and will not ſuffer his affection for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to grow to the loſſe of his liberty and peace of mind.</p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:170100:208"/>
               <p>It is a great folly for one to make himſelfe miſerable out of too much good nature, and to loſe the ſweetneſs of friendſhip by a perpetuall carefulneſſe and allarum. Good things become evill to us when we love them beyond meaſure. There is but one friendſhip where we may love without any meaſure, &amp; where the greatneſſe of the affection brings reſt &amp; ſerenity to the ſoul. It is the friendſhip with God, the only Good perfect and worthy of all our love, who being ſo great yet is able to contract friendſhip with us that are ſo little. If we have the grace to entertaine that friendſhip, which fills the ſoul with joy and goodneſſe, we ſhall eaſily be comforted about the rarity, and weakeneſs, yea and the loſſe of humane friendſhips.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of Gratefulneſſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have obſerved two duties of charity, which contribute much to the Reſt and content of the ſoul; The one is to relieve them that need it; the other, to love them whoſe vertue deſerves it. Theſe two duties require the company of another, which is, To be gratefull to them of whom we have received ſome benefit. For ſpeaking now to generous ſoules, I may obſerve that nothing lyeth more heavy upon their heart, then this reproach of their own mind, that they have not ſufficiently ſhewed their grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto their benefactor.</p>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:170100:209"/>
               <p>Our firſt benefactor is God, for to him we owe all, even what we owe to men. We owe him all that we have, and all that we are, our being and our wellbeing. To him then we muſt do homage for all; and our life being well ſuſtained by a continuall influence of his love, muſt alſo be a continuall courſe of thankfulneſſe. That duty we muſt tend with our words, with our thoughts, with our actions, and more with our affections.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the creature cannot properly give any thing to the Creatour, becauſe all is his, who gives all, and receiveth of none but himſelfe; our gratefullneſs to God muſt be ſhewed to them whom he hath imployed to do us good.</p>
               <p>We muſt beginne by paying debts. If a friend hath opened his purſe to us in our need, or hath helped us with his commodities of which he makes profit, expecting our conveniency to pay for them; It is not only a theft to be ſlack to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, it is ungratefulnes, which is farre worſe; for the plaine theefe abuſeth not the goodnes of his friend; but the ungrateful man renders evil for good, and defraudeth his friend becauſe he had pitty on him. One may doe greater and more profitable kindneſſes then lending of money; Yet there is none where ungratefulnes is more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, becauſe of the love that every one beares to his money, and the truſt that is repoſed upon it
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:170100:209"/>as the ſtaffe of life: Wherefore conſcience and generoſity muſt ſollicite the debtour to pay, and be ſtronger then bonds and compulſions of law to bring him to his duty.</p>
               <p>St <hi>Paul</hi> enjoines us to <hi>owe nothing to no man but to love one another;</hi> A text full of Philoſophie: For there are ſome debts which we muſt not owe long, as debts for things borrowed and taken upon truſt. There are other debts, which we muſt alwayes pay, and alwayes owe; and though we muſt repay them preſently, yet we muſt owe them ſtill after we have payd them: Such are the duties of mutual love, and thankfull acknowledgement of kindneſſes. Pecuniary debts muſt be payd that we may be no more in debt; but as for the debt of love, that debtour is an ill paymaſter that lookes for an acquittance when he hath payd it. He that is truly gratefull deſires alwayes to pay, and alwayes to owe.</p>
               <p>Civil life is a perpetual commerce of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, a continual giving and returning. It is like a ſource that ſprings at the roote of a great oake, and is kept coole by that greene ſhade which it keepes freſh and verdant. Neither na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor human ſociety can ſubſiſt without mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual giving and receiving. But fruitful ſoiles, and generous ſpirits, will yeeld much more then they receive: Now becauſe it is impoſſible for us to live in the world without receiving benefits which cannot be returned, it is ſome gratefulnes
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:170100:210"/>to ſhew to him that obligeth us that we delight to be obliged to him. <hi>Eſt animi ingenui, cui multum debeas, eiaem plurimum velle debere</hi> It is a proud and ſavage humour for one to refuſe a kindnes becauſe he knowes not how to repay it in the ſame kinde or value. It is turning friendſhip into a bargaine: They that will ſtick to that Maxime are ſoone forced to goe from it, though they be never ſo powerfull; for they that have moſt, are moſt needy of helpe, which cannot at all times be repayd. <hi>Saepe etiam dives à paupere plura petebat.</hi> Mans condition is ſo needy that every one depends of his neighbours kindneſſe. And though we muſt aſpire to that evangelical happines, rather to give then to receive, and ſtudy to overcome our benefactours by a noble emulation of beneficence, we muſt not pretend to that advantage proper to God alone, to oblige all men, and be obliged to none. The ſatiſfaction that we may give to ourſelves when we are obliged to one with whom we are like never to meete, or who is ſo high above us that our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits cannot reach him, is to doe good to others that are unable to doe us the like. Then prayers to God are a commerce, whereby the loweſt perſons may benefit the greateſt. And we muſt endeavour to make God a ſurety for us, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be the remunerator of thoſe benefits which we cannot requite.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AS thankfulnes for benefits, ſo ſatiſfaction for injuries, is neceſſary to ſet a generous and religious mind at reſt; I meane of injuries that we have done, not of thoſe we have received. Yet we muſt learne how to behave our ſelves in both.</p>
               <p>As for jniuries received, as a wiſe Chriſtian muſt willingly forget the good that he hath done, being content that God remembreth it; ſo he muſt forget the injuries that are done to him, and be content that God, to whom vengeance belongeth, keepeth them in remembrance. He muſt alſo remember in what need he ſtands of pardon before God, and that without forgiving he muſt not expect to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>If he be ſo offended that he be obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſent it, he will implore Gods aſſiſtance to find honorable and peaceable wayes of ſatiſfaction, and keepe himſelfe cleane from blood and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. And if he think his honour to lye at the ſtake, he muſt think alſo that charity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion are more honourable then impatience, yea then valour. To keepe integrity and peace of conſcience let him ſadly conſider the horrible conſequences of a duell, in which a man either deliberately takes away the life of his neighbour,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:170100:211"/>or himſelfe, loſeth his owne in the act of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let him feare a perpetual biting remorſe, the cry of blood purſuing the murtherer, and the late repenting when one is fallen out with God and his owne conſcience for an unprofitable revenge.</p>
               <p>Be the lawes of honour among ſwordmen never ſo ſevere, a wiſe and godly man ſhall never want wayes, which Gods mercy and wiſedome will ſuggeſt to his prudence, to come out of quarrels with credit &amp; integrity. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.18. <hi>He that feareth God ſhall come forth of all.</hi> Truly he can come forth of a challenge by refuſing it, and keepe both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and conſcience, after the example of many brave men, who are with good reaſon honored for their free oppoſing of that popular madnes.</p>
               <p>That ordinary terme of taking or giving ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with the ſword, is as much againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe as it is againſt juſtice; for how can one give ſatisfaction for an injury by a greater? Is that ſatisfying a man whom you have offended to goe about to kill him? Or is it ſatisfying your ſelfe when you have bin offended to run the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of being killed by the offendour, and put him in poſſibility of getting double victory and double triumph over you?</p>
               <p>That new point of honour for which men maſſacre one another, not ſo much out of hatred as to obey the tyranny of cuſtome, was not knowne in old time among the braveſt men.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:170100:211"/>The Romans did not practiſe it in the flowre of their valour, which conquered the world. But as much as men are decreaſed in valour, ſo much are they increaſed in peeviſh impatience, which in effect is but weakenes. The ſtrongeſt trees are leſſe ſtirred by the wind, and the ſtrongeſt ſpirits are leſſe moved with injuries. As the tops of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> and <hi>Tenerifa</hi> are not beaten with haile, for they ſtand above it; high and magnanimous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſtand above the inſolence of raſh men, and in that litigious ſtorme keepe their ſerenity. It is a good rule, to be moved with no fault but ſuch as we commit. If my neighbour offend me, the offenſe is his, not mine; To him, not to me, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to reſſent it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the injuries, of which we muſt ſee the ſatisfaction made, are thoſe that we have done. If unwittingly or otherwiſe we happen to doe injury to any man with words or actions, it layeth a ſad weight upon our conſcience, which we muſt haſten to unloade, by ſatisfying the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended &amp; ourſelves more, for the offenſe is more in the offendour then in the offended; and when we make ſatisfaction to him to whom the injury was intended, we doe more for ourſelves then for him.</p>
               <p>Reparation muſt be made to God in the firſt place, for in all offenſes he is the firſt offended party, and this is done by repentance, of which wee have ſpoken before. That reparation which
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:170100:212"/>we make to our brethren, may be acceptable to God it muſt have theſe three qualities of godly repentance; It muſt be ſpeedy, free, and total. As the Sunne muſt not goe downe upon Our wrath, let it not goe downe upon that of our neighbour provoked by us, if we may prevent it. It is in us (with Gods aſſiſtance) to diſprove the Maxime which the practice of the <hi>Italians</hi> hath made true among them, <hi>Chi offende non perdona mai.</hi> The offender (ſay they) never forgiveth. It is a great ſhame indeed to have given offence, but the offenſe is greater to refuſe to mend it. The Lord Jeſus our great Maſter having taken care to heale the wound that his Diſciple had made, ſhall wee refuſe to heale the wounds which we have made ourſelves? God ſaith, <hi>Vengeance belongs unto me, I will recompenſe;</hi> there he ſpeakes of the injuries done to us: But as for the injuries done by us, vengeance belongs unto ourſelves, ſo farre as to make recompenſe to them whom we have wronged. Which recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe unleſſe we make, God will make it. Our wiſeſt courſe then is to make that recompenſe ſincerely; ſo may we eaſe God of that care.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of ſimplicity, and dexterity in Society</hi>
               </head>
               <p>PEace with men conſiſteth in doing and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no injury. The firſt (with Gods aſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:170100:212"/>grace) depends of us. Towards the ſecond, though depending of others, we may do much. For the cauſe why ſome are wronged and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, commonly lyeth not ſo much in the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of others, as in their owne imprudence.</p>
               <p>But the end of this Book (the ſame as that of our lives) being not onely peace by doing and receiving no injury, but content by doing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving good, we muſt ſtudy both how to lead a ſafe and inoffenſive courſe of life, and how to be uſefull to ourſelves and others.</p>
               <p>That skill we learne of the great Maſter of wiſedome, who hath comprehended it in theſe two ſhort precepts. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Be ye prudent as ſerpents, and harmleſſe [or ſimple] as doves.</hi> Theſe two he makes into one, becauſe they make together an excellent compound, and becauſe they muſt never be disjoyned. Simplicity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prudence would ſerve onely to make us ſheep for the wolves to eat. Prudence without ſimplicity, though it could get us ſome peace and utility with men would forefeit our peace with God and our conſcience, and ſo prove meere folly in the end.</p>
               <p>How eſſentiall ſimplicity is to prudence it is ſeene in all the parts of converſation, which are reducible to theſe two heads, Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>As for words, it is certaine that ſimplicity is
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:170100:213"/>the moſt requiſite quality, what uſe ſoever they be put to, publique or private, religious or civil. And even the diſcourſes made only for elegancy and delectation cannot attaine their end without ſimplicity; for that gracious expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and powerfullneſs of words, which gets the fame of eloquence, is nothing elſe but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity managed with dexterity. They that go farre from it and make their ſtyle darke to make it ſhew deep, or bombaſt it with extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant conceits, and new ill coyned termes, loſe elegancy by hunting too eagerly after it; there being no ſuch deadly enemy to grace in ſpeech as affectation. Beſides it is found that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes full of affected difficulty are like olive ſtones, which are very hard becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them; and ſtyles puffed up with words are empty of matter, as ſome cheating women have bin ſeene, that appeared great with child when they were big with a pillow. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, the ſolidity of reaſon, and the ſincerity of the mind, are the three magazines affording good and gracious diſcourſes. Where thoſe three meet, the more the ſtyle is ſimple the more elegant it is. And in matter of ſpeech, the beſt ſervice that dexterity can do to right reaſon, is to deliver in cleare termes thoſe thoughts which the mind hath well diſgeſted. So ſhall one ſatisfie others and himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Affectation is alike ungracious in Words and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:170100:213"/>Actions. Affected perſons have that hard fortune that while they ſtudy to diſguiſe themſelves, they diſcover themſelves moſt; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that betrayes a may ſo much as affectation doth. His forced countenance, his ſtudied geſture, the odd quaintnes of habit, give an evident cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a mind diſordered by pride, and a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture drowned in fooliſh artifice. Such men are diſpleaſing to God, who loveth truth and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in the inward parts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. and therefore cannot but be diſpleaſing to themſelves, deſtitute of peace of conſcience and contentment of mind. Melancholy is an inſeperable companion of conſtraint, for who can take delight in that which he does againſt nature? Therefore ſtage buffoones when their jigge is done are very ſad and froward, becauſe they have extraordinarily conſtrained themſelves.</p>
               <p>There is a deeper and craftier ſimulation cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hypocriſy, which knoweth how to perſonate plaine honeſty, and put upon fraud the face of ſimplicity; as indeed without that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to cozen. Simplicity and Integrity are of ſuch price among men, good and evill, that without the ſubſtance, or the ſhew of them, it is not poſsible to entertaine any commerce in the world: And men that have but the ſhew of theſe, deſire to deale with them that have the ſubſtance, becauſe they are true and ſure deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. As wicked as the world is, uprightneſſe is
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:170100:214"/>the ſafeſt courſe to advance a man: for every one will ſay, He is an honeſt man, It is ſafe deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him. The principall is, that thereby we keep good intelligence with God and with our conſcience.</p>
               <p>The chiefe prudence then, is to be honeſt: They that ſeeke to appeare ſuch, and are not, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent; for to enjoy the benefit of honeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, the ſure way is to have it indeed. Counterfeit honeſty is falſe coyne, not ſafe to trade withall; and in the end, it turneth to the undoing of the falſe coiner. But honeſty and prudence have need to be more in reality with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then in ſhew without. For to make a great ſhew of honeſty gives a great ſuſpition of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy; and to make a great ſhew of prudence is aſigne of ſhalloweſs. It is better to ſhew honeſty then prudence, becauſe honeſty is of greater price, and becauſe every one ought to have it &amp; profeſs it: Whereas it is a great point of prudence to conceale it, for that man is not very crafty that ſheweth his craft. He that ſets out much policy in diſcourſe, commonly keepes but little in reſerve.</p>
               <p>Next to integrity, which is the firſt counſell of wiſedome in converſation, the beſt counſell is to know ourſelves, the buſineſs that we take in hand, and the perſons that we have to do with; meaſuring our ſtrength and what we are fit for, that we never meddle with any thing above our
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:170100:214"/>capacity, or that we may deſiſt before we be too far engaged. It is a great point of wiſedome for one to be able to adequate his imployment to his capacity and inclination. But becauſe the choice of our imployment for all our life is commonly made in our nonage by our parents who are many times miſtaken in our genius and ability, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy us where they can, not where they would; we muſt by a vertuous reſolution, bow our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius to our imployment, and ſupply the wants of nature with dexteterity.</p>
               <p>For this there is need of that vertue which the Italians and French cry up ſo much, called <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezza</hi> or <hi>accortize.</hi> A word, which I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to my readers, to be made by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance free denizon of England, if they like it; Let me not be the onely writer of theſe times that dares not coine new Engliſh. <hi>Accortize</hi> is a pliableneſs and dexterity to fit oneſelfe to all buſineſſes and perſons and times. And firſt for buſineſſes, a wiſe and <hi>accort</hi> man muſt make unto himſelfe an univerſall and complying ſpirit, <hi>verſatile ingenium,</hi> to whom nothing ſeems ſtrange or new, &amp; not ſo much affected to ſome certaine things, as to be unfit for all other things. <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Philoſopher, being mocked by ſome Merchants of <hi>Miletus,</hi> upbraiding him that he declaimed againſt riches, becauſe he felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe uncapable to get them, began a traffick whereby in one Summer he engroced the whole
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:170100:215"/>trading of the Towne to himſelfe; Then having ſhewed what he could do, he left trading, and returned to his Philoſophy. It is a ſhame for a man of reaſonable parts to be fit but for one thing; but certainly if one can ſort his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his proper genius, he ſhall do much for the liberty of his actions, the ſucceſſe of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, and the contentment of his mind.</p>
               <p>As we muſt comply with buzineſſes, ſo we muſt with perſons, whoſe ſeveral natures we ſhould therefore ſtudy. To this, natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie will helpe us much, for the inclinations and manners of men will commonly follow the temper of their body. But experience and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are the beſt ſchooles for that ſkill. We muſt carefully obſerve the humours of thoſe perſons that are within the ſphere of our activity that we may take every man in his humour, marking what things they are moſt bent upon, and wherein they are moſt impatient to be croſt. Of all the miraculous gifts of the holy Ghoſt which are ceaſed, I finde none ſo much wanting as the gift of diſcerning the ſpirits, for want of which we miſſe ſo often the compaſſing of our ends with our neighbours, either for their good or our owne. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The heart of man is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, who can know it?</hi> And ſome natures are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to know then others, and need a longer obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Some having planted orchards with great care and coſt, at thirty yeares end beginne to
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:170100:215"/>perceive that the ſoyle was not fit for trees. And many fathers have miſſed that comfort which they might have had from their children, becauſe they have knowne their nature too late, and ſet them upon a courſe of life unſuitable to their minds and abilities. If fathers are thus ſhort in the knowledge of their owne children, and our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with much adoe attaine the knowledge of our owne nature; how ſhall we be able to know the nature of ſo many perſons with whom we muſt converſe, having to doe every day with new men, which ſhew nothing but a plauſible and artificial outſide?</p>
               <p>In that great art of Diſcerning, the proper handles to lay hold of the ſeveral ſpirits, which is the great work of <hi>acccotize,</hi> honeſt and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men muſt have an emulation not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by impoſtors and juglers that make it their whole trade. Truly the children of light have need in this point to turne diſciples of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darknes. They know how to perſwade the generous with honour, the timorous with feare, the covetous with profit, the voluptuous with pleaſure, the proud with praiſe, the devout with conſcience. Of that manner of commerce, of which ſomething is to be taken, ſomething left, the ſincere and prudent muſt learne enough to avoyd circumvention, and to know the ſeveral avenues of the ſpirits with whom he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:170100:216"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accortize</hi> having taught a man to fit himſelfe for the ſeveral buzineſſes and perſons, her third worke is to make him diſcerne the nature of the times, and comply with them as farre as he may with a ſafe conſcience. Every age of the world hath its proper genius, which a wiſeman muſt obſerve; daily ſtudying the raigning hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, the ebbes and flowes of cuſtomes, and the ſignes of approaching revolutions, either to make benefit of the tyde, or to decline it with as little harme as may be, if it ſuite not with his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and inclination.</p>
               <p>He that will maintaine or advance himſelfe in a time full of revolutions and quick turnes, hath need to be of the nature of ivy, which takes hold of all that ſtands neere, gets roote every where, even upon ſtones, and followeth all the turnes of the tree or wall that it ſticks unto. Many might have advanced themſelves in the world, had their conſcience bin as nimble as their induſtry. But it is not advancement but the peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of minde that a wiſe and godly man muſt looke for. Conſcience and ſimplicity are not able to follow all the giddy turnes of the world, eſpecially when one hath a publique im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, where it is as impoſſible to be hid as it would be treacherous to be indifferent. But when conſcience lyeth not at the ſtake, a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man finally muſt yeeld if he cannot overcome. He muſt not blow againſt the wind, nor juſtle
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:170100:216"/>againſt a windmill turning with impetuoſity. The difficulties of life being great and many, and every one being more cleare ſighted in his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours caſe then his owne, we muſt in our difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aſke counſell of thoſe whom we know to be wiſe and honeſt, and to have no intereſſe but our owne in the buzineſſes upon which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult them. It is better to conſult thoſe that are leſſe wiſe then ourſelves, then to take counſell of none but ourſelves in things important. For two eyes ſee more then one; Though another have not better eyes, he may looke upon the buzines by another by as; and if he be not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give us counſell, he is able to forme ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which will be ſo many overtures of counſel. We muſt heare all 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good:</hi> be free and benevolent to all, truſt but few; but ſhew no miſtruſt to any without neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Two contrary faults are the ordinary ruine of buſineſſes, The one is too much fervency and haſte to bow the occaſion to our deſire, whereas we ſhould gently bow our deſire to the occaſion, and ſtay till it be ripe. The other is negligence and ſecurity, preſuming of ones owne merit and fortune, deſpiſing oppoſitions and letting occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſlip. But many times raſh men from one of theſe contraries paſſe to the other, for fiery and haſty men will ſoone relent, and utterly ruine by their negligence what they had ſpoiled before by their haſtines.</p>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:170100:217"/>
               <p>It would be endleſſe and beyond my ſubject to ſpecifie all the precepts of prudence. Others have eaſed me of that labour. I doe but recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ſtudy and practiſe of them to ſuch as will enjoy peace and contentment of minde. We are not Maſtes of events, but we ought to be Maſters of counſels. If a good counſel be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a ſiniſter event, we beare it more eaſily when we can beare witneſs to ourſelves that it is not for want of a wiſe, diligent, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt care. But he that hath ruined his buſineſs through his imprudence hath a double affliction, for his misfortune, and for his folly. I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my-ſelfe from ſpeaking more of prudence in this Chapter, for all I have ſaid hitherto and have to ſay hereafter, is nothing elſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Spake lately of Prudence in Buſineſs; But the greateſt prudence in buſineſs, is to have but few; it being impoſſible to have many without diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace of the foul. And what imprudence is it, to loſe the end for the acceſſories? eſpecially when one is deceived in thoſe acceſſories, and miſtakes for the helps of his content, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his misfortune. The more wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men, the leſſe wee converſe with God. Yea the content which we might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect by our converſation with men is loſt by too
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:170100:217"/>much converſation. For whereas among men there are more wicked then good, and among good men there are more unwiſe then wiſe, it followeth that in great companies (taking them one with another) there is more evill then good, and more folly then wiſedome, and the greater the worſe. It is in few friends well choſen, that the ſweetneſs and utility of converſation conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The leſſeyou appeare in the crowd the leſs ſhall you be crowded, the leſſe ſecret envy and open quarrell ſhall you incurre, the leſs evill ſhall you learne and doe. It is no wonder that young men are inveigled with temptations, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyled in quarrells, and made the prey of cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; The poore youths are newly come into the world, &amp; to ſee it they ſeeke great meetings, they gaze upon all they ſee, ſin for company, or to get experience. But when a man hath ſeen enough of the world to know it, and hath learned wiſedome out of the folly of others, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariages of his owne imprudence, he will content himſelfe to ſee the ctowd afar off, and will not thruſt into it, and medle too farre with this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fooliſh, and dangerous generation.</p>
               <p>We muſt not ſpeak thus out of a preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſingularity, ſo deſpiſing the world that we eſteem none but ourſelves: We muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we have the world in our heart, and that we alſo are wicked, fooliſh and of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous converſation. If the world corrupt us, we
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:170100:218"/>alſo help to corrupt the world. Wherefore as bodies that have the itch; ſo ſpirits infected with vice muſt lye aſunder, elſe they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe one anothers infection, and the infection muſt needs be greater where there is a greater number of infected perſons: Where the crowd of men is, there alſo is the crowd of ill cuſtomes and popular errours. And if it be hard to reſiſt the temptations of vicious perſons when they ſet upon us ſingle, how can we ſtand againſt them when they fall upon us together in a full body? How can we think on any thing but evill when we ſee and heare nothing elſe? How can we lift up our hearts to God and converſe with him, in a confuſed noiſe and tumultuous hurrey, which is the Kingdome of the Devill?</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations have moved ſome holy Fathers to retire into deſerts, to have no other company but God, and tend the worke of their ſalvation without diſturbance. But becauſe God will be glorified by us in the duties of humane Society, and hath not ſent us into the world only to tend our ſalvation, that Retreat from the world is excuſable in thoſe only, that can do as much, or more good to the world living farre from it as living in Society. Such were thoſe who in their hermitages enricht the treaſure of the Church with their divine workes, confuting hereſies and increaſing the ſtock of holy learning. But to leave the world to do good to none but
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:170100:218"/>ourſelves, is fruſtrating the end which God made us, for ſince he hath made us for Society, as it appeareth by the ten commandements, moſt of which regard our duty to our neighbours. A man of good parts that leaveth all Society to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, and gives no fruit of his meditation to the world, is like the Jordan whoſe faire and quick water is loſt in the lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> called the dead Sea; It is to dye living, and loſe the quickneſs of the mind in a gulfe of unprofitable idleneſs. It is leaving the world in the worſt ſenſe, for it is forſaking mankind and denying to Society that Service which we owe. A conſideration able alone to trouble that tranquillity which Hermites and cloyſtred men ſeek in ſolitarineſs. Neither can they make amends to the world by their prayers; for as they pray for us that live in in the world, we pray for them that live out of the world, and ſo we are even with them.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus hath taught us how to uſe ſolitarines; for he retired by night into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to pray, and in the day time he taught the people, and when he was weary of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude he withdrew himſelfe to the company of his diſciples, who were a choice of perſons whom he honoured with the title of his friends, ſo ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his time betweene his particular communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with God, his ſervice of the publique and his communication with his ſingular friends.</p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:170100:219"/>
               <p>One may leave the world, and yet keepe it in his heart; and one may converſe with the world, and yet leave it. A godly wiſeman may find retirednes in the greateſt citties. Hee may paſſe through the crowd and not ſtay in it or mingle with it, as the river of <hi>Rhoſne</hi> goeth through the <hi>Lemane</hi> lake. He will doe ſervice to all if he can, but converſe with few. He may enjoy himſelfe in a multitude of unknowne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as if they were the perſonages of an Arras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanging; for a man is alone where he knoweth no body, and acquaints himſelfe with none.</p>
               <p>For his acquaintance he will pick thoſe whoſe life is vertuous, the ſpirit meeke, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation plaine and eaſy. He will endeavour to deſerve their good will with his owne; being ready and aſſiduous with them when he may ſerve them, but out of that making his viſits ſhort, to oblige them to the like; alwayes leaving his friends company before they be weary of his. In his choyce he will take men ſuch as they be, not depriving himſelfe of the benefit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation out of a preconceit of perfect Idea's of worthy ſubjects of friendſhip; but ſince all men are evill and weake, he will be content with thoſe that have leſſe evill in them, and that have wiſedome enough to know their owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Knowing himſelfe full of imperfections he will beare with the imperfections of his friends, expecting of them the like forbearance.</p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:170100:219"/>
               <p>He muſt labour to have a ſoule with many ſtories, which may ſtoope and riſe according to the ſeveral conditions and capacities of men, not fearing to ſpeake to Kings, not diſdaining to converſe with peaſants, every where equal, modeſt, generous, and reaſonable, reſpecting good ſenſe whereſoever he finds it, and he will find it as often under the ruſſet jerkin, as under ſcarlet and gold lace.</p>
               <p>Becauſe he muſt looke for errour &amp; imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in al ſorts of acquaintance, let him put eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one upon the diſcourſe of thoſe things that he underſtands beſt; ſo ſhall he doe a kindnes to the company, for every one loveth to ſpeak of that wherein he is expert, &amp; he ſhall benefit himſelfe, fetching from every one the beſt that is in him.</p>
               <p>Let him alſo fit his minde for all kinds of buzineſſes, thinking none too great when they are not above his capacity; for thoſe affaires that have more dignity have not alwayes more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: And on the other ſide thinking no buzines too low when it is neceſſary, or when it gives him occaſion to doe good.</p>
               <p>But in general let him charge himſelfe with as few buzineſſes as he can, I meane thoſe buzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that engage a mans minde in the tumult of the world, without which he may find buzines enough to keepe him ſelfe well imployed. Want of preferment is better than want of peace. Let him avoyd thoſe imployments that give, vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:170100:220"/>and yet draw envy, where a man muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſtand upon his guard, imbark himſelfe in factions, and live in perpetuall emulation and contention. The man to whom God keepes the bleſſing of a quiet life ſhall bee kept by him from that glittering rack and golden fetters, but the man whom he will aflict ſhall be given over to be toſſed betweene the competition of others and his owne ambition. <hi>David</hi> ſhewes us <hi>how great is Gods goodneſſe which he hath layd up for them that fear him,</hi> namely <hi>that he wil hide them in the ſecret of his preſence from the pride of man, he will keepe them ſecretly in a pavilion from the ſtrife of tongues. Pſal.</hi> 31.19.20. But what! there are ſome ſpirits that love noiſe, and live by Contradiction, and when old factions are worne out, hatch new ones, ſowing quarrels that they may be ſticklers, and in ſuch ſort arbitrating differences as to make them immortall that ſo they may never want buſineſs. To ſuch men no worſe impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be made then that they may alwayes have the buſineſs which they love; for as they ſerve the father of diſcord they are like to ſhare in his reward.</p>
               <p>But thoſe are worthy of his compaſſion, whoſe ſerene religious ſoules, capable and deſirous of high contemplation, are aſpiring towards the God of peace, but are diſtracted with contentious buſineſſes, and preſt down with worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though perhaps too high for their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:170100:220"/>yet too low for mind; which meaſuring the height of things by their diſtance from heaven, finds the great Offices of the State very low, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are deeper in the earth, and further from heaven; then other Offices of an obſcurer note. Who would not pitty a great perſon that hath ſcarce time to eate and ſleepe, that muſt have a light brought to his bed to make diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es before day, and when he goeth to the Court hath much adoe to get out of his yard through the crowd of ſuitors? and in that clogge of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, what time hath he to examine the ſtate of his conſcience and labour to advance his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God? Where is any gaine able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile that loſs?</p>
               <p>But there are more perſons undone for want of buſineſſes, when they have not the capacity to find themſelves worke of ſome utility, eſpecially when the love and feare of God have not taken root in their hearts. For there being in the ſoul three Offices or audits, the firſt for contemplation, the ſecond for paſſion, and the third for action; when a mans mind is unfit for contemplation, &amp; wants action, he giveth himſelf wholly unto paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Then a man tickleth himſelfe with evill deſires and vaine hopes, gnawes his heart with envy and ſpite, and torments himſelfe with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience; theſe vices being bred and fed by idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Such men having nothing to do, deviſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill or uſeleſſe buſineſſes, going up and downe all
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:170100:221"/>day long like ſwallowes that flye round not knowing for what, walking from one end of the Town to the other to viſit one that will not be at home when they aske for him, or is put to his ſhift to be rid of their company. Of that kind are moſt of thoſe that thruſt one another in the ſtreet, as buzy as if they had three Chancery ſuites to ſolicit; then returne home late, weary, and ſweating, having found the invention to tire themſelves and do nothing. In effect, an idle life is more painfull and weariſome then an active and negotious life. It makes one ſad, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and vicious. He that doth nothing cannot but do evill, as grounds left untilled will bring thiſtles</p>
               <p>But he that hath an ordinary employment, of ſome utility to the publique, hath no leaſure to attend vaine and evill actions, nor to be ſad; By doing good he contenteth his conſcience and maintaines the ſerenity of his mind, ſo that he embrace no more then he can hold: They that will doe too much good, do it ill, and do harme to themſelves. It is a prepoſterous diligence when it brings vexation to a mansſelfe.</p>
               <p>Rich old men ſhould do wiſely to give over buſy imployments of the world vvhich require a whole man, to give themſelves wholly to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of man, as he is a man and a Chriſtian. If they be ſpeculative, judicious, and experienced men, they may do more good to the world in
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:170100:221"/>their retirement then in the crowd of buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>They that lead an active life ought not to give but lend onely their mind to the buſineſſes of the world. A wiſe man will follow his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſions with diligence and induſtry, but he will not tranſubſtantiate himſelfe into them. In our buſieſt imployments let us retire often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to enjoy God and ourſelves, labouring chiefly to preſerve his favour and our peace. Without theſe, all labour is ſuperfluous or evill, and gaine becomes damage,</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of Moderation in Converſation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is a moſt neceſſary proviſion for any man that will lead a peaceable life, in this age and theſe regions, torne with diverſity of parties; Mens minds being ſo generally exulcerated, that in caſuall meetings either they caſt a ſuſpicious eye upon their Contreymen becauſe they know them not, or abhorre them becauſe they know them. Here then there is need of a meek, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant induſtrious and univerſall mind, retired within himſelfe, and healed of that epidemicall itch of light-brained men, to declare all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and inclinations, and quarrell with all that are otherwiſe diſpoſed.</p>
               <p>It is an old and uſefull obſervation, that God hath given us two eares and one mouth, to teach
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:170100:222"/>us that we ought to heare more then ſpeake. To which it may be added, that we have no eare-lids to keep our eares from hearing, and often muſt heare againſt our will; but our mouth ſhuts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and we may keep our tongue from ſpeaking, unleſſe by our intemperance we loſe that priviledge of nature.</p>
               <p>God indeed hath not given us a tongue to hold our peace: But, that we may uſe it ſo that our neighbours may receive good by it, and we no harme, there is need of a great meaſure of charity and diſcretion.</p>
               <p>To that end a wiſe man will not be the chiefe ſpeaker in an unknowne or dangerous company, but be content to ſecond thoſe that are more able or more willing to ſpeake, unleſſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be like to turne to a contentions matter, for then it will be prudently done to put the company upon ſome innocent diſcourſe accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all. But companies are apt to ſpeake of that which hath the vogue; of points of State in factious times, and of points of religion almoſt at all times.</p>
               <p>As for points of State any man may be bold to interrupt the diſcourſe, ſaying, Let us leave State buſineſſes to Statesmen.</p>
               <p>The diſcourſe of religion, the great occaſion of falling out, muſt be turned, if we can, to the uſe of comfort and amendment of life, rather then arguing about points of beleefe. Indeed we
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:170100:222"/>we are commanded to <hi>be alwayes ready to give an anſwere to every man that aſketh us a reaſon of the hope that is in us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. Which when we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, we muſt doe it as the text modifieth it, <hi>with meekenes and feare;</hi> not with bitternes &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. And the Apoſtle requires of us to be <hi>ready to anſwere,</hi> not eager to queſtion. Reaſon ſerveth to convince, but charity is the chiefe and welnigh the onely way to perſwade. Vehemence will make an adverſary ſtiffer, for even the force of an inſoluble argument, though calmely propounded, makes no other impreſſion upon prejudicate ſpirits but to make them ſtartle; and finding no helpe in reaſon, to leane the more fiercely upon paſſion. Though you ſtop your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries mouth, you ſhall not thereby convince his reaſon; and though you convince his reaſon, you ſhall not turne his beleefe: For that, you muſt winne his affection, and affection is not wonne with Syllogiſms; for I ſpeake of men not ſuch as they ſhould be, altogether ruled by right reaſon; but ſuch as they are for the moſt part, blinde and heady, having their reaſon enſlaved to cuſtome and paſſion. There is great difference betweene convincing and converting: The firſt may be done by the goodnes of the cauſe, or the ſubtility of the diſputant; But converting is the worke of God onely. It is enough to perſwade us that ſpirit and ſoule are too different things, when we ſee ſpirits capable of the higheſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:170100:223"/>reaſons to be unable to underſtand plaine reaſoning about matters that concerne their ſalvation. In vaine ſhall you convince the ſpirit with reaſon, unleſſe God open the eares of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>In ſuch meetings, in ſtead of ſeeking wherein we differ, and falling out about it, we ſhould ſeeke wherein we agree, and praiſe God for it. If newes were brought to us of the diſcovery of a great Chriſtian Empire in <hi>Terra Auſtralis,</hi> where they beleeve the holy Scriptures, and the Creed, and receive the foure firſt General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels; No doubt but it would rejoyce us much, and we would love them though they differed from us in the doctrines built upon thoſe common grounds. And why doe we not beare with our neighbours and countrey-men who agree with us in ſo many fundamentall points, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the ſame God, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt; who embrace the promiſes of the Goſpel in Jeſus Chriſt, and endeavour by the love of God and the exerciſe of good workes to glorifie God and attaine to his kingdome? Could we abhorre one another more if one partie worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Chriſt and the other Mahomet? Even where the quarrel was onely about points of Diſcipline, the diſſenſion was heated even to confiſcations, battells, and ſacking of townes; So furious is ſuperſtition, and funeſt in its effects, what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſoever it take; for it is found in good and evill
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:170100:223"/>parties, being natural to all weake and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſoules: If it maintaine falſhood it diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oureth the truth by putting a wrong byaſſe upon it. It is a compound of ignorance, pride, raſhnes, and cruelty; All which moulded with a baſtard zeale, and infuſed in black choller, make up the moſt malignant venome of the world.</p>
               <p>For one that is of the ſtronger party it is inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to provoke him that is of the weaker in the moſt ſenſible point of all, which is conſcience. And for him who is of the weaker party to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him that is of the ſtronger, it is both inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and folly.</p>
               <p>In a milde and well compoſed ſpirit, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errours of others moove pitty not hatred; And if pitty ſets him on to reduce them to the ſaving truth, prudence will take him off betimes from that deſigne when he ſeeth it impoſſible; And it is impoſſible when charity will not doe it, which muſt not be violated for any pretence whatſoever. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10. <hi>Mercy and truth ſhall meet together, righteouſnes and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> Truth cannot be eſtabliſht without mercy, nor righteouſnes without peace. Making breach in charity to preſerve faith is demoliſhing the roofe of the Church to mend the walls. Having found by the trial of a hundred yeares that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells and ſyllogiſms will bring no general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, let us fight no more but by prayers, and let all parties ſtrive for the palme of charity and
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:170100:224"/>moderation. The two rivers of <hi>Danubius</hi> and <hi>Sauns</hi> falling into one channel goe thirty leagves together unmingled. If the difference of our opinions will not ſuffer us to mingle, yet we may joine. Let us goe quietly together in our common channel, the State where we live, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame end, the publique peace and the glory of God. This conceit I owe to that bleſſed ſonne of peace, that rare teacher and high pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of moderation and tranquillity of minde the right Reverend Biſhop Hall, who hath not written one onely booke <hi>of Chriſtian moderation;</hi> but all his learned and gracious workes, and the whole courſe of his wiſe and religious life are a perpetual comment upon that golden vertue.</p>
               <p>When we conferre of any matter with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a different tenet, our end muſt ever be to find the truth not to get the victory. And that end muſt be ſought with a meeke and moderate way. That milde courſe will yeeld us a double benefit, for it will preſerve the liberty of our judgement, which is taken away by the heate of diſpute and precipitation. A haſty diſputant will ſoone be brought to <hi>non plus.</hi> Beſides when good ſenſe is aſſiſted with moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it ſinks better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the adverſaries reaſon, as a ſoft ſhowre ſoakes the ground better then a ſtormy raine. A mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate rational man either ſhall win the aſſent of his adverſary or his good opinion.</p>
               <p>Railing and inſultation are offenſive, more to
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:170100:224"/>him that uſeth it then to them that are miſuſed by it, for when paſſion riſeth high in words, it giveth a prejudice to the hearers, that reaſon is out of combat. Anger is an ill helpe to reaſon for it diſableth reaſon from helping itſelfe. Dogs that bark much ſeldome bite, for it is feare that makes them barke.</p>
               <p>Great and good workes are done with little noiſe. So was the worke of ſalvation done, the beſt of all workes: Of the Author and finiſher whereof <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſhall not ſtrive, nor lift up, not cauſe his voyce to be heard in the ſtreets: Iſa.</hi> 42.2. Wherefore when Devills poſſeſſing mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies cryed out in his preſence, He commanded them to hold their peace, for the Devill loves noiſe and tumult, but God loves peace, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſerenity.</p>
               <p>It is a precept fit for the Goſpell of peace, <hi>Let your moderation be known of all men. Phil.</hi> 4.5. The word of the Text <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, properly ſignifies <hi>equity.</hi> Of that equity the grand rule is to do to others as wee would have others doe to us. Which in the point of converſation, our preſent matter, ought to make us deale with others with that patience reſpect and moderation, which we expect of them; not ſetting forth our opinions imperiouſly, nor rejecting the opinions of others arrogantly, remembring that all men by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall condition (never throughly mended by grace in this life) are inwrapt in a deep miſt, and that all our reaſoning is groping in the darke;
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:170100:225"/>Let us paſſe gently over the errours of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to oblige them to the like kindneſs.</p>
               <p>If we knew how few things we know, and how lamely, we would make uſe of reaſon and diſcourſe rather to ſeeke inſtruction then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce aphoriſms. If we find ourſelves capable to cleare a matter, let us do it without awing the company with peremptorineſs, or wearying it with multitude of words. No diſcourſe is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table when it is tedious. In every matter there is commonly but one eſſentiall reaſon, or two at the moſt. More reaſons ſerve for illuſtration, or to fill up, and many times to invalid the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Three good reaſons for the ſame thing, are worſe then one.</p>
               <p>The greateſt uſe, and indeed the greateſt trial of moderation in conference, is to avoyd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the intereſſe of the thing with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe of the perſon, of ones ſelfe eſpecially. For where ſhall you finde thoſe ſerene unmoved minds, who hearing their opinion taxed of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; folly wil not preſently ſtart &amp; take more paine to prove, that they are no fooles then to weigh the reaſons, and judge impartially where the truth lyeth? Moſt men being thus diſpoſed, he that will oppoſe their opinions muſt proceed with great moderation, leſt that, being touched in credit and perſonal reſſenting, they make the truth ſuffer for their private intereſſe. We muſt charitably conſider that every one loveth the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:170100:225"/>productions of his owne braines, as his children, and is ſenſible of the abuſe offered unto them. And we muſt bring our charity to this beleefe that every one is in good earneſt of the opinion which he profeſſeth, and thinks himſelfe to be in the right. <hi>Il proprio parer non ha mai torto.</hi> You beleeve he is in an errour, he beleeves the ſame of you, And he will never think himſelfe to be in the wrong, till it be repreſented to him with ſolid reaſon, ſweetened with ſingular meekenes and reſpect.</p>
               <p>Moderate and ingenuous ſpirits (O how rare they be?) finding themſelves preſt with reaſon and truth, will freely yeeld the bucklers; They winne, when truth overcomes. But it is a flight, to uſe fradulent ſhifts, oppoſing right reaſon with ſophiſtry, and when a man is overcome, &amp; is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to yeeld, throw duſt in the eyes of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. That peeviſh and ungenerous point of honour is learned in our Schooles, never to yeeld any thing as long as one can maintaine it by right or wrong. One errour is defended by another, and a man comes to beleeve in earneſt, that which he had alledged before out of deſpaire.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a point of moderation to conſider ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely what it was that gave occaſion to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and practiſes which are deſervedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. There is no doctrine ſo horrible, no diſorder ſo foule, but there is much to learne out of it. Looke to the ſource: Something will
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:170100:226"/>bee found obſcure or ill expounded in the termes of the received doctrine, or ſome exceſſe or defect in the ordinary practiſe, which gives occaſion of exceptions, and then of ſeperation, and againe of oppoſition and faction to ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and turbulent ſpirits. There is no rebellion but was occaſioned by ſome fault in the Sate. Let us never looke upon thoſe publique tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions but with a reflection upon the cauſes. Which if they be paſt our mending, we muſt try whether we may mend ourſelves by them; learning by the faults of others and the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, moderation in our judgement, and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humane weakeneſs, which is uncapable of a ſincere and conſtant keeping of any good, loſeth the benefit of good things by turning them to the wrong ſide, laboureth to cure one evill by a greater, and killeth the patient to heale the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> who had beheld all the good &amp; evil of the world with a judicious eye, upon that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe giveth us this precept of moderation. <hi>Be not righteous overmuch, neither make thy ſelfe overwiſe. Eccleſ.</hi> 7.16. He that cenſureth too magiſtrally the evill that is done in the world by errour of judgement and raſhneſs of paſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth not enough the infirmity of mankind and his owne, and ſheweth that he knoweth not the world. Errour, vanity, ſuperſtition, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of warre and the vices of peace, faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:170100:226"/>and ill deeds, private ends cloaked with publique good, the advancement of few men conſiſting of the depreſſion of many, the zeale of idiots ſetting up a ladder for the riſing of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious; All theſe are the courſe of the world. So it went before our time; So it will go after. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Say not thou what is the cauſe that the former dayes were better then theſe? for thou doſt not inquire wiſely concerning this.</hi> Wiſemen are ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at nothing, and make profit of all.</p>

This laſt Book will be but gleaning in the ſame field. Let us gather ſome ſingular counſells proper for our main end, either omitted before, or worthy to be further inſiſted upon.</p>
               <p>Let the firſt Counſell be that great preſerver of tranquillity, to content ourſelves with our condition. This counſell depends of another, much urged before when we ſpake of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of vertue in adverſity, which is to will what God wills; a right Chriſtian &amp; reaſonable leſſon. To any that is in his right ſenſe this reaſon ought to be ſufficient to make him contented with his condition, that it was ſo diſpoſed by Gods wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. He will haveit ſo. It is rebellion and folly to have a contrary will.</p>
               <p>This ought not to be a barre to our induſtry and keep us from mending the incommodities of our condition; for God putting us in an uneaſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, doth not oblige us thereby not to ſeek to be better. Thoſe to whom God hath given no other ſtock but their induſtry, have reaſon to think that God will have them to make the beſt of that excellent patrimony. Piety and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy are no counſellours of lazineſſeand neglect of ourſelves. A poore man is content with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition when he is pleaſed with that neceſſity which God layeth upon him to maintaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:170100:227"/>by his diligence, and ſupply by his vertue the want of an inheritance. A condition com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more happy then that of great heires whoſe intellectuall parts are many times dulled or corrupted with plenty, which puffeth them up with Pride and enflames them with luſt. He that is kept in humility and temperance by his ſhort meanes muſt praiſe God for it, and make the beſt of the benefits of poverty, the chiefe whereof is, that it helpes a man to weane his heart from the world, and raiſe it unto God.</p>
               <p>The rich and great having more cauſe to be contented with their condition have neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe more need to be exhorted unto it, becauſe they are more ſubject to be diſcontented, for eaſe breeds wantonneſs and makes a man to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commôded with his owne commodities. This is that <hi>ſore evill</hi> which <hi>Solomon ſaw under the Sunne, namely riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. Eccleſ.</hi> 5.17. Many rich men eate their bread in darkneſſe all their dayes, and with a covetous or envious ſorrow make their plenty their croſſe.</p>
               <p>That ungratefull ſorrow proceeds from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive love of ourſelves and the world. We love ourſelves ſo much that we think nothing good enough for us; And the world ſo much that we can never have enough of it. Now al im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate love is accompanied with great care, and that care ſowreth all the ſvveetneſſe of our life.</p>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:170100:228"/>
               <p>Theſe two loves then muſt be cut very ſhort. He that will love and eſteem himſelfe but little will be content with little. And he that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes his love from worldly things, ſhall ſoon have as much of them as he needs.</p>
               <p>To weane ourſelves from the love of ourſelves and the world, we muſt ſtudy to get a ſtrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the wiſedome and goodneſs of God, and a firme confidence in his love. Suppoſe that God ſhould ſpread with his rich and liberall hand all the treaſures of the world before us, and give us our free choice to take what we would; Could we do more wiſely then to put the choiſe to him againe, and beſeech him to chooſe for us, becauſe he knowes what is fit for us better then we do, and loves us better then we love our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Well, this is our condition; God hath choſen for us; Let us ſtand to his choyce with humility and thankfullneſſe, and reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
               <p>It is an appurtenance of the condition which God hath allotted us, that we muſt continually labour to mend it; though we ſhould have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to raiſe it: for our temporal is condition like our houſes, which muſt often be repaired, elſe they would ſinke downe. All humane things are in a continuall decay; But God hath given prudence to man to underprop his tottering for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or to build it anew, and make it more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious: So much we may do and yet be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:170100:228"/>with our condition, gently ſubmitting our minds to that generall law of the life of our vanity (as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it) which binds us to toyle continually to maintaine ourſelves. In that toyle if the ſucceſſe ſmile upon us and invite us to advance, though we were content with our condition before, we may better it. If notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our induſtry our fortune go back, our deſire alſo muſt go back with our fortune, and be content with leſſe; in both conditions looking up to the good hand of God, whoſe actions are all mercy to them that love him and truſt to him.</p>
               <p>To that end we muſt aske of God a meek, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, equall, &amp; conſtant mind; not ſeeking content in things that are about us, but in things within us, labouring to have God there; for when all is ſayd and tryed it is the onely way to be content in all conditions. God being alwayes the ſame, he that poſſeſſeth God is partaker of that divine attribute in his meaſure, and in the ebbings and flowings of his temporall condition remaines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ſame, becauſe the poſſeſſion that makes him happy is within him and in heaven together, not ſubject to exteriour changes, not tyed to things under the Sunne.</p>
               <p>As he that hath a vigorous body, and the noble parts ſound wil eat browne bread &amp; groſſe meat with good appetite, but to a ſick man pheaſants are unſavoury. So to him that hath a ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:170100:229"/>and God abiding in it, the meaneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is pleaſant; but a man of an ill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that hath the burning fever of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ambition, taketh delight in nothing, though he had all things. He that poſſeſſeth God hath this advantage above all other men that he he is content with much, and with little, and with nothing. Therefore, to ſpeake exactly, we ſhould not ſay that he that poſſeſſeth God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>with,</hi> but <hi>in</hi> his temporall condition; for it is not from his condition that his contentment ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, it is from God.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis Counſell is part of the precedent: for that we may be contented with our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is neceſſary for us not to depend upon the future. He that can bring his mind to that, ſhall not live ſuſpended with deſires and expectations, and ſhall not loſe the enjoyment of the preſent to catch at that which is to come. When the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the preſent makes us long for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is leſſe ſtrange and more pardonable. But it is ordinary that covetouſneſſe, curioſity, &amp; wantonneſs, produce the ſame impatience in ſome men, as extremity of paine in others. Many ſick of too much eaſe will ſpeak like <hi>Job,</hi> in his torments; <hi>Job.</hi> 7.4. <hi>When I lay downe I ſay, When
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:170100:229"/>ſhall I ariſe and the night be gone? And I am full of toſſings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</hi> Is the day dawned, they wiſh it were done. This perpetual agitation is a moſt evident ſigne of a ſick mind, which makes his ſicknes worſe with that only thing whence he hopes for amendment, which is change. The future which afarre off ſeemed pleaſant unto him diſpleaſeth him when it is become preſent; neither doth any thing pleaſe him but what he hath not and cannot have. By this expectation of the future, a man hath his head torne betweene feare and hope as a ſtagges head betweene two hounds, ſo ſore they bite and torment the minde. There is no condition more miſerable, and no ſtate of the ſoule more contrary to the nature of God whom his children ought to imitate: Nothing ſets a man further from God, who expects no new thing from the future, becauſe all is preſent to him. With whoſe conſtancy we have ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation when we ſtay ourſelves upon him, our preſent and eternal good, and depend not upon the uncertaine future. The godly wiſeman aſpires onely to one certaine future, the full poſſeſſion of his ſoveraine good, which as yet he doth but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly poſſeſſe; As for the doubtfull future he leaves it to Gods providence, in whoſe reſpect that which is doubtful to us is certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Since our care can alter nothing in it why ſhould we vexe our heart about it? If evill
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:170100:230"/>muſt come, let us not haſten its comming by our apprehenſion; and if good muſt come, let us not ſpoile it by our impatience.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of the decrees of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which ought to eaſe us of care muſt not bereave us of prudence, for the prudence of man is employed by the providence of God for the execution of his counſels. So when prudence calles upon us to give order for the time to come, we need but follow this rule, <hi>To doe what we ought and can doe, and let God doe what he will.</hi> By that meanes we ſhall keepe the wiſe <hi>medium</hi> between diffident care and imprudent negligence: Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing with an ingenuous ſimplicity the dictates of prudence and conſcience, truſting in God, and doing good, we ſhal not be diſtracted betweene trembling feares and ardent deſires for the time to come, being confident that whatſoever may happen to us, either good or evil, all will turne to our good, as long as we ſtick faſt to our ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine good which is God.</p>
               <p>That we may not depend of the future we muſt ſtudy to keepe our minde free of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the vulgar ſort, the curioſity of things to come, whether they concerne them or no, onely becauſe they are to come. This is a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the preſumption of our firſt parents who would know that which belonged to God onely to know. For the knowledge of the future belongeth to God onely, and yet men pretend to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:170100:230"/>it. Both the knowledge which is proper to us and that which is forbidden, is ſet downe in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine leſſon, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God, but thoſe things which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that we ſhould doe all the words of Gods law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is that curioſity excuſed with the deſire of avoyding evill to come; for if it muſt come it cannot be avoyded by knowing it before. It is enough to expect inevitable evils, we need not ſend for them by our curioſity.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that the moſt curious of the future are none of the beſt men, but perſons of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled greedines, and ſet upon ill ends. None conſulteth ſouthſayers to doe a vertuous action. A good ſoule, that truſteth in God and feares him, will patiently expect his good pleaſure, ſaying, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Behold God is my ſalvation I will truſt and not be afrayd;</hi> Come what will, it will come from God, and nothing but good can come to me from that good hand, ſince God is my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But evil conſciences tremble at the thought of the future, and at the ſame time burne with deſire to know it, and becauſe they cannot know it of God they are eaſily perſwaded to aſke it of the devil.</p>
               <p>As they are none of the beſt ſo they are none of the wiſeſt that are moſt carryed away by that curioſity, but the weakeſt natures, as ſimple maydes, that eaſily find inventions to ſee in their
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:170100:231"/>ſleepe what they deſire when they are awake. Perſons of the meaneſt condition and capacity are moſt eagerly ſet upon the knowledge of the future, and finding ſome fright in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence when they goe about thoſe inquiſitions, they ſtop their eyes not to ſee the iniquity of their ends and wayes.</p>
               <p>That wilfull blindnes is increaſed by the craft of Satan, preſenting wayes in themſelves indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to theſe ſilly curious minds, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not that the harme doth not conſiſt in uſing ſuch words or geſtures, but in aſcribing to them an unnatural vertue without warrant of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of nature, and in ſeeking to ſee that which God hath hidden. Certainly ſince God hath hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the future, to goe about to lay it open, is a worke proper to the profeſt undoer of Gods workes.</p>
               <p>Curioſity of the future carryeth many ſo farre as to make a covenant with the devill. Who yet ſtands not ſo much upon his points as to refuſe to be conſulted by thoſe that have made no cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him. No doubt but this pride is tickled with a miſchievous delight when he ſeeth men ſeeking to him for that which is proper to God and herein yeelding to him divine ſervice.</p>
               <p>Which ſervice that he may receive in a civil and occult way from the fine ſort of wits, he hath deviſed ſome ſeeming ſublime divinations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them that the decree of God about hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:170100:231"/>events is written in the motions and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral aſpects of the ſtarres, and therefore that this ſort of divination is lawfull, yea divine.</p>
               <p>The evills that come from that perſwaſion are numberleſſe, for the ſilly reverence which vulgar ſpirits deferre to theſe predictions makes them wilde, and ſets them upon the fullfilling of them, becauſe they account them unavoidable. The worſt evill is, that thereby mans minde which ought to dwell at home is tranſported out of himſelfe, &amp; inſtead of repoſing upon the love and wiſedome of God is ſuſpended upon the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons tayle and the Aſcendant of an Horoſcope.</p>
               <p>The hiſtories of the Greeke Emperours <hi>Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Manuel</hi> are lamentable examples how credulous perſons are undone by the impoſture of Aſtrologers when they expect from the Starres thoſe ſucceſſes which ought to have bin wrought by piety, prudence, and valour. That unlucky art cuts the ſinewes of induſtrie, and makes men idle, greedy, and inconſiderate.</p>
               <p>This reaſoning I recommend to the calme judgement of the lovers of that Science. All affirmation is grounded either upon reaſon or authority. The aſſertions of judiciary Aſtrology are of the laſt kinde, for no reaſon can be given of their Maximes. Now the authority upon which theſe Maximes are grounded muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divine, or humane, or devilliſh. They are not grounded upon divine authority, but are
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:170100:232"/>expreſſely forbidden by it. God will not have us <hi>to be diſmayed at the ſignes of heaven, for the heathen are diſmayed at them, Jer.</hi> 10.2. and threatens <hi>the Aſtrologers, the ſtarre-gazers, &amp; monethly prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, that they ſhall be as ſtubble, &amp; the fire ſhall burne them. Iſa.</hi> 47.13. Human authority in this caſe is of no weight, for who hath given power to men to diſpoſe of the ſeverall Offices and preheminences of celeſtial bodies? It remaines then that theſe maximes are grounded upon diabolical autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In effect, ſince they are not grounded upon reaſon, either they are forged by men, or deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by revelation; and if that revelation come not from God, it muſt needs come from the devill.</p>
               <p>The truth of this ſentence, that man is an enemy to his owne content, is ſeene in nothing ſo much as in that itch of curioſity to inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the future. Whereas we ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that our ignorance of the future is the onely infirmity which we have reaſon to be well pleaſed with. God hath done much for mankind to have hid the future from them. For if beſides preſent afflictions we had diſtreſſes to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, there is no conſtancy but would breake under that weight. Many owe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tranquillity to their ignorance of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that waite for them.</p>
               <p>But it is not the hope of future wordly content that muſt hold up our minds. The life after this life is the onely future, upon which we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:170100:232"/>And after we have ſublimated our hopes and untyed our affections from the earth, if it pleaſe God to ſend us ſome worldly proſperity, it will be the more welcome becauſe it will come unexpected, as a gaine over and above the bargaine.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III <hi>To retire within ones ſelfe</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HE that hath learned to know the world and himſelfe, will ſoone be capable of this counſell. The world being fooliſh and wicked, it will be a wiſe part to retire (as much as the duties of converſation will permit) from that contagion which may impaire us. Perſons that have ſome goodneſſe in their ſoul have a cloſſet where they may retire at any time, and yet keep in Society.</p>
               <p>That cloſſet is their owne inſide. Whereby I underſtand not all that is within man, for the Appetite is not the cloſet but the outward Court where all the tumult is; there the Paſſions are entertaining the externall objects, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with them. But that inſide to which the wiſeman muſt retire is his judgement &amp; conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thence to impoſe ſilence to paſſions and huſh all the noyſe below, that with a calme and undiſturbed mind he may conſider the nature of the perſons and things which he converſeth
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:170100:233"/>with what intereſſe he hath in them, and how farre they are appliable to Gods ſervice and to the benefit of himſelfe and others.</p>
               <p>We judge better of things when we are little intereſſed in them, for then we are leſſe apt to foreſtall our judgement with our affection. Then to poſſeſſe a cleare, free, and uningaged judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the things of this world, we ſhould learne well how little intereſſe we have in them, and that we are ſtrangers in earth; whence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre St. <hi>Peters</hi> doctrine <hi>Dearely beloved, I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrimes abſtaine from fleſhly luſts.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. For why ſhould we entertaine any eager deſire for things that concerne us but little? Even among Pagans the wiſeſt lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the goods of this world as things which they needed not, and retired within their own breaſts, which they called their home, there to enjoy vertue their onely good. The wiſe Chriſtian having that high advantage that he may enjoy within his breaſt both vertue and God himſelfe, hath more reaſon to keep within that home, and look upon things without, with an indifferent eye. For when as Pagan Philoſophers called themſelves Cittizens of the world, the Chriſtian acknowledgeth himſelfe aſtranger in it; for he doth but travell through the earth to his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Country, which they knew not. A traveller looking out of the window of his Inne upon a country Faire, doth but lightly amuſe his eyes
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:170100:233"/>with the variety of courſe pedling wares, and the buzy ſtirre of buyers and ſellers; but his minde is upon his journey, and he will not make one in that crowd. With the like indifference the wiſe Chriſtian looks upon the hurry of the world, and the confuſed diverſity of humane things, not crowding for them, or ſetting his heart upon them; for his journy towards heaven calls him away, and to heaven he hath already ſent his heart before.</p>
               <p>That diſintereſſed diſpoſition towards the things of this world ought not to make us care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and negligent; neither muſt we do any buſineſſe by halfe: Keeping that prudent and godly temper to apply our mind, not our heart, to worldly things; never forgetting, while we tend them with diligence and induſtrie, that they are unworthy to poſſeſſe the whole man, who is made for better things.</p>
               <p>There is no poſſeſſion ſooner loſt then that of ones ſelfe. The ſmalleſt things rob us of it. A ſight worthy of contempt, if not rather of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, is a man ſharp-ſet upon play, whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hurried out of his true home by the greedines of gaine, is ſwelled with hope, and quaking for feare hanging upon the chance of the dice. Had one driven us from our houſe we would cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud for juſtice againſt him; But we diſpoſſeſſe ourſelves from the poſſeſſion of our reaſon by our violent paſſions, and refuſe to do juſtice to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:170100:234"/>How many for a Miſtreſſe or a preferre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment loſe their meat and their ſleep, have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought all the day long, and no other dreame all the night? their ſoules are no more at home, but dwell with their neighbours, if we may call dwelling a perpetuall running after hopes that flye from them. To ſuch men this counſell is moſt proper, <hi>Tecum habita,</hi> Dwell at home. Keep poſſeſſion of your ſoul. Suffer not any thing to ſteale you away from your ſelfe. There is neither profit nor pleaſure worth ſo much, that the ſoule ſhould goe from home to get it. Let none ſooth up his eagernes about his ſports with the plea of lawfull paſtimes; Nothing is lawful that ſteales the ſoule from God and a mans ſelfe. When I ſee a man run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after his bowle, and following it with bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings or curſes: Another melting with ſweat in a tennis-court, more overheated yet in his paſſion then in his body, contending with high words about a chaſe; then ſay I with compaſſion. Alas here is a ſoule put out of poſſeſſion of herſelfe, a man that hath forgotten his origine and his dignity, having his reaſon enſlaved to his paſſion, and his paſſion ſubjected to things of no value; which being in their nature uncapable to be his maſters, he hath found a way to make them ſo by his wilful ſlavery. One is allwayes a looſer at that game which robbes his ſoule of ſerenity. It is an unlucky game that gives to the nobleſt part
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:170100:234"/>of man thoſe great irregular motions which ſhould not be pardonable for the conqueſt or the loſſe of an Empire. Nothing is ſo great that for it we ſhould ſet our mind out of frame. A wiſeman neither in jeſt nor earneſt ought to ſubject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to any external object, or ſuffer his ſoule to ſtirre out of her place, and runne into diſorder. Utility and Pleaſure ſought by diſorderly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are loſt even by ſeeking.</p>
               <p>Of this counſel to retire within onesſelfe, this is a branch, To keepe company with a few well choſen perſons, lending ourſelves freely to them but giving ourſelves to none but God, nor ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friendſhip to grow to ſlavery. With all ſorts of men we muſt deale ingenuouſly, yet reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaying what we think, but thinking more then we ſay, leaſt we give power to others to take hold of the rudder of our mind, the thing that all crafty negotiatours aime at. Let them not be admitted by too much familiarity to know the weake avenues of our ſoules. For in all ſoules there are ſome places weaker then the reſt. Theſe every one ſhould endeavour to know at home, and view them diligently, there to double the fortifications of piety and wiſedome, taking heed of lying uncovered that way.</p>
               <p>Alſo to enjoy that ſelfe-retirement we muſt keepe ourſelves, as much as we can, impartial among the diverſity of parties and opinions. Where the queſtion is not abſolutely of our duty
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:170100:235"/>and ſalvation, we muſt put on the patience to ſee and heare, and ſay nothing. How many truths in the world are of that nature, that it is better not to defend, yea not to examine them, then to trouble the world or onesſelfe about them? How many rights, which it is better to leave altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undefended, then to wrong our ſerenity to maintaine them? And how many controverſies of which the <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> is falſe? Some conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this age are ſuch, that a man of good ſenſe muſt not care where is the right or the wrong. Among ſo many turbulent actours, he muſt content himſelfe to be a beholder, judge of the blowes; and ſtand out of their reach.</p>

               <p>THis counſell will be a graine of ſalt to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the precedent. For it is the excuſe of idle perſous that will appeare contemplative men, to ſay that they will judge of all, and meddle with nothing; whereas they ſhould be imployed about their owne buzineſſes, that they might have no leiſure to meddle with the buzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of their neighbours.</p>
               <p>Indeed the practiſe of this counſel is neceſſary for the obſervation of the three counſels of which I ſpake laſt. To be content with our condition we muſt avoyd idlenes, for <hi>the ſoule of the ſluggard
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:170100:235"/>deſireth and hath nothing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi> 13.4 Idlenes makes a man needy and covetous. But diligence makes his condition eazy. A great delight it is too ſee the fruit of our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe that we may not depend from the future, we muſt avoyd idlenes: for idle men are gaping after the future, becauſe lazines makes the preſent time bitter unto them. Dayes and houres ſeeme to goe a ſlow pace to him that expects of fortune what he might and will not obtaine of his diligence.</p>
               <p>And as for the third counſel of retiring within ones ſelfe, idlenes is very much contrary to it, for a man that doeth nothing groweth tedious to himſelfe, and ſeekes out of himſelfe how he may cozen the weariſome houres, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.21. <hi>All the Athenians and all the ſtrangers that were at Athens ſpent their time in nothing elſe but either to tell or to heare ſome new thing:</hi> For idleneſſe is the mother of curioſity. It makes a mans mind to gad a broad and keeps it in a perpetuall pilgrimage; for the mind is never at home but when it keeps neere God, and is employed in ſome good thing.</p>
               <p>The mind is never content till it be fixt, and it will not be fixt but upon imployment. Who ſo will content his mind let him do what he ought to do, for nothing brings more ſadneſſe to the mind then a wandering idleneſſe. I call idleneſs
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:170100:236"/>not onely to ſit with ones armes a croſſe but to give oneſelfe to an evill or uſeleſſe labour. For many have no other labour but to diverſifye their idleneſſe and give themſelves more paine to invent how they ſhall loſe their time, than would have coſt them to imploy it well. And when the mind is once ſoftned and enervated with idleneſs, he will give eare to any evill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, for he that doth nothing is ſoone induced to do evill, and even by doing nothing he doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. Time idly and viciouſly ſpent makes a man ſad and peeviſh; all things diſpleaſe him, and himſelfe more then any thing.</p>
               <p>None can excuſe his idleneſſe ſaying that he hath nothing to do, for there is alwayes ſome good to be done; and none ſhall ever bee idle who hath as much will as occaſion to do good. To do good is the proper labour of thoſe who by their wealth and quality are commonly exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from labour. Of that condition likely were ſome of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that they <hi>did not worke at all but were buſie bodies.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.11. Yet without reſpect of any quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he gives them this charge, <hi>Now them that are ſuch we command and exhort by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that with quietneſſe they work &amp; eat their own bread. But ye brethren be not weary in well doing.</hi> He will have them that live curiouſly, working not at all, to worke, and eat their owne bread, and to work firſt before they eat. Of which if they excuſe
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:170100:236"/>themſelves, ſaying that they are not men of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the Apoſtle ſheweth them what work God requires at their hands, It is that <hi>they faint not in well doing.</hi> Then his exhortation <hi>that with quietnes they worke eating their owne bread</hi> intimates this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance unto them that an innocent labour will give a good taſte to their bread, and that they ſhall enjoy Gods gifts with quietneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>To avoyd Curioſity in divine matters.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>CUrioſity in the things of God is one of the principall hinderances of the peace of the ſoul. In nothing the propagation of the firſt ſin is more evident. It is the right ſlip of the folly of our firſt Parents, upon whom God had beſtowed the whole plenty and beauty of Nature gathered in one ſpacious garden, planted with choiſe trees. In that garden nothing was denyed them but ſo much as was hurtfull, The tree of ſcience of good and evill; A Science which God kept to himſelfe. Yet in the midſt of that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing wealth, they were diſtaſted with all that was given them, out of a greedy deſire to taſte that which was denyed them; and for taſting of the tree of ſcience of good and evill, they were driven farre from the tree of life.</p>
               <p>We likewiſe their ſinfull progenie put our
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:170100:237"/>ſelves far from the tree of life, by ſtretching our hand unto that unlucky fruit of forbidden know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. And many ſpeed ſo ill in their curious ſearch, that while they are about to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like God, by their knowledge, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like Satan by their audaciouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>But how doth it come to paſſe that the ſtudy of the knowledge of God, which is the Soveraine good of man, ſerves to make him guilty and miſerable, and that too often they that ſoare higheſt to draw neere to God, are found moſt remote from him? It is becauſe they goe the wrong way to worke. For whereas they ſhould ſtudy his love (a gulfe where a man is allowed to wade above his ſtature) they ſearch his hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and inſcrutable counſell: No wonder if they that will creep into Gods ſecret will, loſe the benefit of his declared good will; as <hi>Adam</hi> preſuming to lay his hand on the forbidden fruit loſt the poſſeſſion of ſo many fruits, the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof was free to him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> having made that high requeſt to God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18.23. <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew mee thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> God anſwered him, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee my backparts but my face ſhall not be ſeene.</hi> A myſterious Text, which being well underſtood aſſigneth the juſt extent and ſets the certaine limits to humane reaſoning in divine matters.

               <p>Were this well ſtudyed and comprehended aright, more labour ſhould be beſtowed upon the meditation of Gods workes of nature and grace &amp; of his revealed will, for by theſe onely it is poſſible to man living in the fleſh to ſee God in ſome meaſure. And the darke queſtions of Gods eternall counſell ſhould be layd by.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of predeſtination ſettleth the ſoul in a ſtedfaſt aſſurance, when it is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by faith; but the ſame brings trouble and perplexity to a mans heart when one will fathom Gods counſell with the plummet of reaſon. In that poynt Reaſon is prone to frame objections againſt the juſtice and wiſedom of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ere it go too farre, the bridle of piety muſt give it this ſhort ſtop, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20. <hi>O man who art thou that replyeſt againſt God?</hi> If about the actious and decrees of God you cannot ſatisfye your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, remember that <hi>reaſon was made for man not for God,</hi> and be ye quiet.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe theſe in incomprehenſible points of the concurrence of Gods grace with mans will, &amp; how his invariable decree may conſiſtwith the free actions of men, reaſon muſt altogether ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſe her inquiry, acknowledging that in that
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:170100:238"/>meeting of the finite with the infinite, reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finite can comprehend nothing but things of her kind. Since then there is ſomething of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in that meeting, the comprehenſion of it muſt be left to the infinite God, to whom alone it belongs to know his infinite workes. In that meeting all that belongs to us is to have no other will but Gods, embrace his grace with a free and ready heart; truſt in his promiſes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ourſelves to his providence. A wiſe counſell, eaſier to obſerve then to comprehend, is this, <hi>That in the worke of our converſion and ſanctification we muſt give to God the whole glory and to ourſelves the whole taske.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo of the reſiſtence of ſo many mens wills againſt Gods will, which nevertheleſſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, even by reſiſting it, that holy will having no part in the evil which they doe; And of the wiſedome of that high moderatour, who for his glory tolerateth the kingdome of the devill in the midſt of his kingdome, we muſt acknowledge that they are matters for admiration not inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a goodly ſtudy to be a diſciple of Gods wiſedome and providence; but where we find our contemplation brought to <hi>non plus,</hi> we muſt be contented to beleeve that God is all wiſe and all good. Let him doe his pleaſure and let us doe our duty.</p>
               <p>The holy Scriptures are the cleare ſpring of life. Our Lord Jeſus commands us <hi>diligently to
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:170100:238"/>ſearch them, becauſe in them we hope to have eternal life. Ioh.</hi> 5.39. The texts leſſe perſpicuous, as they require more ſtudy, they require alſo more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. And better it is to ſay of a hard text, <hi>I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it not,</hi> then to wreſt it with a forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. The writers of Comments upon whole bookes of Scripture are often put to that choyce. Yet how few are extant that will ſay ingenuouſly, This text is above our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and we muſt expect till he that hath lockt up the ſenſe of it, give us a key to open it. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be put to the uſes attributed to it by St <hi>Paul, doctrine, reproofe, correction, inſtruction in righteouſnes. That the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furniſhed unto all good worke.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. For theſe uſes there be ſo many cleare texts that we need not beate our braines againſt the hard ones.</p>
               <p>It is a commendable ſtudy to ſeeke to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Canonical prophecies; God himſelfe gave them to the Church to be ſtudied. And ſeeking the intelligence of them is obeying Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures drligently.</hi> But in that command he meanes the prophecies fullfilled which ſpeake of his firſt comming, not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies yet to be fulfilled: Which yet we may ſearch but with that reſervation, that we content ourſelves with ſo much as is clearely revealed, and preſume not to ſeeke into that which is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Wherein the ſtyle of prophecies is a ſure
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:170100:239"/>guide, for we muſt beleeve that the Holy Ghoſt hath hidden them in obſcure termes that they ſhould not be underſtood; and if God will not have us to underſtand them, it is folly and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy for us to goe about it. Why ſhould we fecke to ſee that which God hath hidden? he hath hid it becauſe we ſhould not ſee it. I am inclined to beleeve (yet ſubmitting to better jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements) that the end of moſt prophecies is not ſo much that we might foreknow things to come, as that we might admire the wiſedome, and preordination of God, when they are come; and to comfort us in the aſſurance that the whole courſe of the conduct and trials of the Church, and her deliverance and glory in the end, is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained in Gods counſell. Let us ſtay a little. Events will expound predictions.</p>
               <p>As we muſt not curiouſly examine the word of God, we muſt not ſcrupulouſly ſearch the worke of his Spirit. Many devout ſoules yeeld a wrong obedience to this precept of St <hi>Paul, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your owne ſelves whether you be in the faith,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. for inſtead of examining their owne ſelves they examine God, ſeeking with a tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and overbuzy care what degree of comfort and aſſurance of their ſalvation they feele in their hearts, which is the worke of God not of men. And as in the ſearches of jealouſy, when a man ſeekes for that which he feares to finde, they draw upon them that which they feare by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:170100:239"/>it with too much curioſity, and frame doubts to themſelves by examining of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>To heale themſelves of that timorous curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity they ſhould not take for Goſpel whatſoever godly men have written of the manner how the holy Ghoſt is working in the conſcience; for it is certaine that he worketh diverſly according to the diverſity of natures, and doth vary the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of his graces according to his good pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when we examine whether we be in the faith, it is not the worke of God that we muſt examine but our owne. And we muſt call ourſelves to account whether we love God and our neighbours, and what care we take to ſerve him: whether we keepe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and receive his promiſes with obedience of faith. In theſe things where the worke of Gods grace is joined with ours we have but our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance to examine, looking upon Gods worke with reverence, and aſcribing to him all the good that is in us. Which reverence muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled when we conſider in us that worke of grace where the worke of man hath no ſhare, and ſuch are the heavenly comforts and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al joyes. Of theſe we muſt not curiouſly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine the manner and meaſure, as though the ſeale of our adoption conſiſted in theſe: for it is not in feeling comfort but in departing from iniquity
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:170100:240"/>that this ſeale conſiſteth; as we learne of St <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. Confidence is a great evidence of grace, but Love is a greater.</p>
               <p>Let us imploy ſpiritual joyes when it pleaſeth God to ſend them, to improve love and grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in us. Do we find ourſelves deſtitute of thoſe joyes? let us ſtudy to find out in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences the cauſes of that want, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them; labouring to clarifye our ſouls of all mire of the earth, that they may like pure Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals receive the gratious and comfortable rayes of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe. But as long as God gives us the grace to love him, and caſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon him, <hi>Let his grace be ſufficient unto us; for his ſtrength is made perfect in weakeneſſe.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. Joy and comfort cannot but follow faith and love: Perhaps not very cloſe, but feare not, they will and muſt needs follow. Let us expect their comming in ſilence and hope, and take heed of putting them back with curioſity and impatience.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the care of the Body, and other little Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SInce we ſeeke the content of the mind, the body muſt not be forgotten; for as long as they live perſonally united in this world they can hardly be content the one without the other.
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:170100:240"/>That the body may do good ſervice to the mind, the mind muſt be a good Maſter to the body and maintaine it with great care.</p>
               <p>I ſay with great care, not with much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for we muſt uſe it to be contented with little, and with things eaſie and ordinary, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſſe for pleaſure then health, which yet is the way to get a laſting pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Of all earthly treaſures health is the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Without the health of the body, the mind hath much adoe to maintaine his liberty and ſtability. The diſorder of the humours of the body makes the mind turbulent &amp; froward, and ſometimes reaſon is quite turned upſide downe by a corporall indiſpoſition. It is then the part of a wiſeman to take a moſt ſpeciall and exact care of his health.</p>
               <p>It is preſerved by theſe three principal meanes, Serenity of mind, a ſober diet, and exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Of theſe three antidotes againſt all diſeaſes, the chiefe is, Serenity of mind. This and the health of the body maintaine one another. But the mind is a more powerfull agent upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then the body upon the mind. A meek and cheerefull ſpirit keepeth his body healthfull, whereas frequent exceſſive fits of choler, and deep ſadneſſe, ſowre the whole maſſe of blood, and poyſon the fountaine of animall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Whereby the body loſeth his lively colour and his good plight, and droops into a lingering
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:170100:241"/>conſumption. <hi>Heavineſſe in the heart of man makes it ſtoop. By ſorrow of heart the ſpirit is broken. A merry heart doth good like a medicine, but a broken ſpirit dryeth the bones,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> And to get that merry heart he enjoynes us to keep our mind in a milde temper. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.17. <hi>The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull man doth good to his owne ſoule, but he that is cruell troubleth his owne fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The body thus preſerved in health by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of mind, payeth him readily for that good office; for the mind is kept tranquill and ſerene by the good conſtitution of the body.</p>
               <p>To preſerve both, ſobriety is neceſſary; there being nothing that weares the body and ſets the mind out of frame ſo much as intemperance doth. Neither are thoſe that glut themſelves vvith meate and drink the onely that need to be exhorted to learne ſobriety. Many that go for ſober, need that exhortation: For generally all that live with ſome plenty eat and drink too much, and confound in their ſtomack too many various ingredients; giving to nature more then it needs, and more then it can diſpenſe; Which ſuperfluity, that eſpecially of the third concoction, turnes into ill humours, whence va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of diſeaſes is bred, anſwerable to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our diſhes, as in the Commonwealth uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſons, and ſuch as have nothing to do, are they that ſtirre ſeditions and trouble the State.</p>
               <p>Then naturall heate which ſerves to the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:170100:241"/>faculty weares away before the time, when it is put to an overgreat labour; and the ſpirits ſerving to make the pot boyle below, leave the intellectual part ill ſerved in the upper roome. That overplus of aliment growing to pride of blood, breeds no better effect in the ſoule then to ſwell the appetite, and ſtirre it to rebellion againſt the reaſon. If we could bring ourſelves to a more ſimple and leſſe abundant dyet, both our bodies and minds would enjoy more health. The fewer vapours the belly ſends to the braines beſides the neceſſary, the clearer is the ſkie in that upper region. Therefore, to keepe health and ſerenity, ſuch as have a daily plentifull fare, and feare that their ſtomack hath more appetite then ſtrenght, ſhall doe wiſely to faſt ſometimes, to give it time to reſt, and recover ſtrength. Moſt ſickneſſes in their beginnings may be healed by abſtinence.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide they that uſe a more ſparing dyet ſhould allow to themſelves ſome intervals of good cheere. It oppreſſeth thoſe whoſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meales are ſo many feaſts; but it reneweth the vigour of thoſe that uſe it ſeldome. Wine is eſpecially given of God <hi>to make glad the heart of man. Pſal.</hi> 104.15 It is of ſingular vertue to charme cares. Two draughts of it extraordinary when the minde is vexed with croſſes, will put upon a mans buzineſſes a ſmoother and calmer face.</p>
               <pb n="462" facs="tcp:170100:242"/>
               <p>The third preſerver of health is Exerciſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the body becomes an unwieldy bagge of corrupt humours. Great eaters need more exerciſe. But the moſt ſober need ſome. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalleſt and pleaſanteſt is walking, to which they that lead a ſedentary life muſt allow ſome time. But to moſt men their buzineſſes give bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſe enough, many times too much, to the prejudice of the minde, which thereby is neglected and made ſervant to the body. If one be ſhut up, or hath loſt the uſe of his legs, he muſt invent ſome other way inſtead of walking to exerciſe his body and prevent ſicknes; And if he cannot put his body to any exerciſe, he muſt cate and drinke the leſſe.</p>
               <p>It is a wiſe courſe to harden the bodies of children and young men, eſpecially againſt cold, the cauſe of moſt ſickneſſes in aged perſons. But when one hath bin tenderly brought up, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence to goe about to inure his body to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in his declining age. The minde may be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that reſolution, not a tender body that needs carefull tending.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the general precepts to preſerv health. To mend it when it is impaired, Phyſicians muſt be conſulted, and remedies uſed: About which two rules muſt be obſerved. Let it be betimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſicknes have taken roote; Let it be ſeldome, for too many remedies are worſe then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. I preſuppoſe that Phyſique and Phyſicians
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:170100:242"/>ſhall be uſed as it is preſcribed by the Sonne of <hi>Sirac, Ecclus.</hi> 38.1. <hi>for neceſſity</hi> not for wantonnes.</p>
               <p>The chiefe uſe of that art is to prevent diſeaſes. Every one ought to have enough of it to know his owne body, and keepe off the indiſpoſitions to which he feeles himſelfe obnoxious, not to weare out his body with drugs without great neceſſity. But there are certaine ſimple and eazy helpes that prevent great inconveniencies when they are uſed betimes: And what wiſeman would not keepe himſelfe from grievous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, if the uſe of a little ſauge or juniper ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will doe it?</p>
               <p>What remedy ſoever be uſed for prevention of ſickneſſes, take it for certaine that they are better prevented by abſtinence from unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome things then by the uſe of wholeſome.</p>
               <p>Let the body be well clad, for commodity not ſhew, neither curiouſly affecting the mode, nor oppoſing it with a fantaſtical ſingularity. Let all that we weare be comely and handſome, not to pleaſe other mens eyes but our owne. He that is ſlovenly in his attire thereby groweth ſad and dejected, ere he be aware: Why ſhould one make himſelfe contemptible to the world and diſpleaſing to himſelfe by a wilfull lazy neglect of his perſon?</p>
               <p>Let there be order and ſuitablenes in our ſtuffe and furniture, though never ſo coorſe. Let not any thing want its proper place, though never
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:170100:243"/>ſo little. Confuſion is offenſive to the minde but order gives a ſecret delight.</p>
               <p>Let our dwelling be lightſome, if poſſible; in a free aire, and neere a garden. Gardening is an innocent delight; it was the trade of man in the ſtate of Innocence.</p>
               <p>With theſe if one may have a ſufficient revenue an honeſt employment, little buzines, ſortable company, and eſpecially the converſation of good bookes with whom a man may converſe as little and as much as he pleaſeth, he needs little more, as for the exteriour, to enjoy all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that this world can afford.</p>
               <p>Of the paſtimes of the Nobility and Gentry thoſe ſhould be preferred that bring a publique utility, as hunting the wilde boare and the wolfe, where the countrey is annoyed with them, and in England the fox, and the badger. It is double content to a generous and well given nature when he doeth good for his pleaſure. The mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary paſtimes of young Gentlemen in France and Italy are uſefull and pleaſant; and by them they are faſhioned, and fitted to ſerve their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>Games of hazard diſcompoſe the minde extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily: They accuſtume it to be hanging upon the future and depending on fortune, to which every wiſeman will give as little power over him as he can. They do alſo provoke paſſion; and cauſe great agitations in the ſoule for things
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:170100:243"/>of nothing. All that, point blank contrary to the worke of piety and Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>Games that conſiſt in dexterity of body or minde are preferable to thoſe that are committed to blind chance. Cheſſe will ſharpen the wit but buzy it overmuch, and toyle the ſpirits inſtead of recreating them, which is the proper uſe of play. Of all gaming, the leſſe the better; And when it diſordereth the paſſion, the leaſt is too much.</p>
               <p>He that ventureth much money at play, ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not with it the tranquillity of his mind a thouſand times more precious, but makes a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine loſſe of it, whatſoever become of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. That bold venturing comes not out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the goods of this world (as gameſters would have us to beleeve) but out of an unſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able greedineſſe to gaine much in ſhort time. Wherefore to them that have little money and to great lovers of it, great loſſes at play are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmarting; and yet the gaine is more hurtfull then the loſſe: for it enflameth covetouſnes, and ſets the heart upon a wicked labour to grow rich by the ruine of others, which afterwards is practiſed in the more ſerious commerces of Society. Thereby alſo the fountaine of charity is drained, and ſo the ſtreames of charitable deeds. Beſtowing money in play is not the way to make friends with that unrighteous Mammon that receive a man into eternal habitations, but ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to turne him out of his temporal habitation.
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:170100:244"/>It is the way to loſe both earth and heaven.</p>
               <p>When you have an undoubted right to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſumme of money, and the preſent poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion; what a mad part is it to call it in queſtion whether it muſt be yours or anothers, and decide the queſtion with three dice? And what ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to the great giver of all goods gifts, to play thoſe goods away which are afforded to us by his liberality, and acquired for us by the ſweate and hard labour of many poore families? Though then the parties at play be conſenting to that ſtrange way of acquiſition, that conſent doth not make it lawfull; neither of them being the owner thoſe goods which he calls his, but the keeper and ſteward, who muſt give account of his ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip to his Maſter.</p>
               <p>Whether we winne or loſe conſiderable ſummes at play, we commit robbery; for if we rob not our adverſary, we rob our family, and ourſelves, and God. Herein worſe then that ill Servant that hid his talent in the ground; for the gameſter if he be a loſer hath made away the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent intruſted unto him by God. And though he be a gainer, yet he hath made himſelfe incapable to give a good account of his talent to his Lord, ſince he hath put it to an unrighteous banke.</p>
               <p>Eloquence is a pleaſant and profitable paſtime, both to read and compoſe; For while it delights the mind it doth poliſh, ſweeten, and heighten it. It is then moſt delightfull when it ſerveth to
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:170100:244"/>cloath good matter, and when the chiefe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is good ſenſe. And it fals out happily that the eloquenteſt books of antiquity are alſo the beſt, and they that have the wiſeſt reaſon expreſs it with moſt elegancy. The ſame is true of the late Authors.</p>
               <p>Poetry delighteth much, So one take little of it at once, for it is luſhious meat, too much of it brings wearineſſe and loathing. It is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to read then to compoſe, herein like muſique which delights the hearers more then the Muſicians. As then it is better to heare a Set of violins then to make one in it, it is better to heare Poets then to augment their number. I had rather that others ſhould make me ſport, then I them.</p>
               <p>I need not be curious in the ſearch of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall devices of men to paſſe their time; the task of the wiſe being not to ſeeke them, but to uſe them well when they meet in his way, and more yet to learne to live contented without them. What we want of them muſt be ſupplyed with ſerenity of mind, and an eaſineſſe inventive to frame to ourſelves divertiſements, and make a paſtime even of our misfortune. If we may be merry it matters not upon what ground, ſo it be not evill. A ſerene mind that truſteth in God and doth good needs not look abroad for mirth: He fetcheth mirth out of his owne ſtock.</p>
               <p>To get the true taſte of the outward content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:170100:245"/>of life, we wuſt but taſte them, not ſtretch our ſtomack upon them; expecting our onely true contentment from God and within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We muſt make uſe of all things and ſtay upon God alone. The ſenſe of Gods love and our reciprocall love to him give to the ſoul that onely true content; but they take not from us the taſte of the outward lawfull contentments of life. Rather they give us that taſt: for to him that loves God and rejoyceth in his love, all things looke pleaſantly. The certainty of his principall good keeps him ſo cheerefull, that he takes contentment in in the ſmalleſt things; as he that hath newly received tidings of great joy is well pleaſed with a coorſe entertainment, and delights even in thoſe things that diſpleaſed him before.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Concluſion. Returne to the great principle of the Peace and Contentment of Mind which is to ſtick to God.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FRom theſe ſmal contentments let us remount to the great and principall, and their ſtay. It conſiſteth in the peace of God and union with him by faith and love. There we began, there we muſt end. We have conſidered the world ſufficiently, to conclude that it conſiſteth in three poynts, Vanity, Wickedneſſe, and Miſery.</p>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:170100:245"/>
               <p>What is beſt in it is periſhable. When we have it in our hands it ſlips between our fingers, and when it ſtayes with us yet it is none of ours, ſince it is out of ourſelves. Among all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our ſenſes, none is capable to give us a perfect and durable content.</p>
               <p>Being thus unſatisfyed of all things without us, if we enter within ourſelves, what ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do we find in our nature? we find errour in our opinions, tumult in our paſſions, hardneſs or terrour in our conſcience, when God dwells not in it by his grace.</p>
               <p>Pagan Philoſophers teach us indeed that within us or no where, comfort is to be found. But alas! poore men, they ſought nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves but themſelves. And what is more weake, more inconſtant, and more calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous then man? Then, to this Philoſophy one point is wanting, which is all; and that is, to ſeeke God within us, inviting him by humility &amp; repentance to chooſe his abode in our ſoules, and there entertaining him with love and faith. This is the only ſafe harbour for peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of mind. Out of it, there is nothing but ſtorme. The beſt worldly ſtate is vanity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. Of this <hi>Solomon</hi> is an excellent witneſs who having ſeene all the evill, and tryed all the good of this world, pronounceth this verdict. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.14. <hi>I have ſeene all the workes that are done under the Sunne, and behold all is vanity and
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:170100:246"/>vexation of ſpirit.</hi> That great King having long enjoyed an unparallelled proſperity, ſaith in the end that <hi>he hated life, and hated all his labour; Eccleſ.</hi> 7.17, 18. although his labour was to content himſelfe being exalted to the higheſt Orb of power, overflowing with plenty, and ſwimming in delights. What reaſon then have diſtreſſed men to hate their life and labour, when they weare out their life in want, in lawſuites, in ſickneſſe, and receiving no other ſalary of their vertue but envy and ungratefulneſs? Wherefore that wiſe Prince having throughly conſidered all that is good and evill in this world and this life, ends in this concluſion which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to his Sonne. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.12. And further, by theſe, my Sonne, be admoniſhed; <hi>Of making many bookes there is no end, and much ſtudy is a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fleſh. Let us heare the concluſion of the whole matter. Feare God and keep his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God ſhall bring every worke into judgement with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So doth <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſs that God is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both of our duty, and of our reſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and that the only ſafety and ſolid content conſiſteth in ſticking faſt to him. There we finde refuge in our dangers, confidence in our feares, comfort in our ſorrowes, counſell in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, light in darkeneſſe, and life in death.
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:170100:246"/>There we learne to make the right uſe of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, enjoying the gifts of God with chereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſimplicity, not vexing ourſelves with cares to keepe them, or with covetouſneſs to increaſe them. There we get a gracious illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to our underſtanding, a rule to our will, a bridle to our appetite, a ſincere joy in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>How great, how unſpeakable is that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when our heart is turned into a Sanctuary, where God himſelfe is pleaſed to dwell and ſpeak peace to our ſoul, aſſuring us that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled towards us in his Beloved! There he leads us into all truth, helps up our weakeneſs, inſtructs our ignorance, raiſeth us up when we fall, and ſets us againe in the right way when we are gone aſtray. We are aſſaulted by many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but <hi>they that are for us, are more then they that are againſt us,</hi> ſince <hi>we haue alwayes the Lord at our right hand.</hi> We are unwiſe, but we have free acceſſe to the Soveraine wiſedome to conſult it at all times. And many times that high wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, preventing our conſulting, mends what we have marred by our folly.</p>
               <p>Which preſent bleſſings are ſmall being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to our glorious hope. That incomparable honour and, wealth to be received into all the rights of Gods children, that incorruptible crowne of life, that fulneſſe of joy in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods preſence; they are depthes not to
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:170100:247"/>be fathomed with mans thought. But whereas for materiall things the extent of our ſight is long, the reach of our armes but ſhort. In things ſpirituall and eternal it is quite otherwiſe with us; for the two armes of the ſoul, which are love and faith, reach much higher then the eye ſight of reaſon can penetrate: With theſe armes the godly ſoul layeth hold upon the celeſtiall goods which ſhee cannot ſee, and with a lawfull haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe antedates in the preſent the poſſeſſion of the glory to come.</p>
               <p>That expectation makes the Chriſtian to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt any bitterneſſe, and calmely paſſe by all the incommodities of life. For he will ſay in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, This but a ſtep of ill way to an eternall glory; All theſe evils have an end, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins a felicity without end.</p>
               <p>Without looking ſo farre, the preſent ſenſe of the love of God to us breeding our reciprocall love to him; and that mutuall embrace of God and the ſoule living yet in the fleſh, though as ſhort of the perfect union with God as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mountaines come ſhort of heaven, yet brings to the ſoul a dignity and contentment beyond all expreſſion. It is that peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding and keeps our hearts and minds through Jeſus Chriſt. It is a transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the devout ſoul for an earneſt of her glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. It is the betrothing of the Spouſe with Chriſt, and the contract before the marriage.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:170100:247"/>After that, all the Empires of the world, all the treaſures of Kings, and all the delights of their Court deſerve not to be lookt on or to be named. If that divine Embrace could continue, it would change a man into the image of God from glory to glory, and he ſhould be rapt up in a fiery cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret like <hi>Eliah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To enjoy that holy Embrace and make it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as the ſoul in the fleſh is capable of it; We muſt uſe holy meditations, prayers, and good workes. Theſe ſtrengthen thoſe two armes of the ſoul, faith and love, to embrace God, and hold him faſt; doing us that good office which <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> did to <hi>Moſes,</hi> for they hold up the hands of the ſoul, and keep them elevated to heaven.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that God who dwelleth in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heavens dwelleth alſo in the humbleſt ſoules, let us indeavour to <hi>put on the ornament of a meek &amp; quiet ſpirit, which in the ſight of God is of great price.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. It is a great incouragement to ſtudy tranquillity of minde that while we labour for our chiefe utility, which is to have a meek and quiet ſpirit, we become of great price before God; and therefore of great price to ourſelves: How can it be otherwiſe, ſince by that ornament of a meeke and quiet ſpirit we put on the neereſt likeneſſe of God of which the creature can be ſuſceptible; For then the God of peace abiding in us makes his cleare image to ſhine in the ſmooth
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:170100:248"/>mirrout of our tranquill ſoul, as the Sunnes face in a calme water.</p>
               <p>Being thus bleſt with the peace of God we ſhall alſo be ſtrong with his power, and among the ſtormes and wrackes of this world we ſhall be as ſafe as the Apoſtles in the tempeſt, having Chriſt with them in the ſhip. It is not poſſible that we ſhould periſh as long as we have with us and within us, the Saviour of the world and the Prince of life.</p>
               <p>The univerſall commotions and hideous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of our time prepare us to the laſt and greateſt of all, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. <hi>when the heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noiſe and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the Earth alſo and the workes that are therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi> In that great fall of the old building of Nature, the godly man ſhall ſtand ſafe, quiet, and upright, among the ruines. All will quake, all will ſinke, but his unmoved heart, which <hi>ſtands firme, truſting in the Lord. Pſal.</hi> 112.7. Mountaines and rocks will be throwne downe in his ſight, The foundations of the world will crack under him, Heaven and Earth haſting to their diſſolution will fall to pieces about his eares; but the foundation of the faithfull remaines ſtedfaſt; He cannot be ſhaken with the world, for he was not grounded upon it. He will ſay with <hi>Davids</hi> confidence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me, becauſe he is at my right hand I ſhall not be moved.
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:170100:248"/>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope. For thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thy holy One to ſee corruption. Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life; in thy preſence is fulneſſe of joy, at thy right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
